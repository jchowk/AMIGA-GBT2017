@article{gritton2017,
	Abstract = {High-velocity clouds (HVCs) hydrodynamically interact with their surroundings. In scenarios with small clouds, the net result is erosion of the HVC, but in scenarios with large, massive clouds, it is capture and cooling of environmental gas by the cloud. In order to examine these effects over long periods of time, we made detailed three-dimensional hydrodynamic FLASH simulations of massive HVCs (1.35 × 10 5 M ☉ to 1.35 × 10 8 M ☉ ) traveling through hot, low-density media like that in the extended Galactic halo, circumgalactic media, and intergalactic space for at least 200 Myr. By setting the metallicity of the clouds to differ from that of the ambient gas, we were able to track the transfer of material between the two media. We found that massive clouds condense substantial amounts of ambient gas, up to 100% of their initial mass in certain cases. This gas cools to temperatures below 1.0 × 10 4 K, but retains some high ions. The amount of condensed gas depends on the cloud mass, the ambient density, and the cloud density and temperature, but apparently not on the velocity. We discuss the ramifications for cloud survivability and for the transport of halo, circumgalactic, and intergalactic gas to the disk of the Galaxy aboard massive HVCs.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the metal-enriched circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a massive galaxy at z = 3 using results from "ErisMC," a new cosmological hydrodynamic "zoom-in" simulation of a disk galaxy with mass comparable to the Milky Way. The reference run adopts a blast wave scheme for supernova feedback that generates galactic outflows without explicit wind particles, a star formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold and high-temperature metal cooling. ErisMC's main progenitor at z = 3 resembles a "Lyman break" galaxy of total mass M vir = 2.4 × 1011 M &sun;, virial radius R vir = 48 kpc, and star formation rate 18 M &sun; yr-1, and its metal-enriched CGM extends as far as 200 (physical) kpc from its center. Approximately 41%, 9%, and 50% of all gas-phase metals at z = 3 are locked in a hot (T > 3 × 105 K), warm (3 × 105 K > T > 3 × 104 K), and cold (T < 3 × 104 K) medium, respectively. We identify three sources of heavy elements: (1) the main host, responsible for 60% of all the metals found within 3 R vir; (2) its satellite progenitors, which shed their metals before and during infall, and are responsible for 28% of all the metals within 3 R vir, and for only 5% of those beyond 3 R vir; and (3) nearby dwarfs, which give origin to 12% of all the metals within 3 R vir  and 95% of those beyond 3 R vir. Late (z < 5) galactic "superwinds"---the result of recent star formation in ErisMC---account for only 9% of all the metals observed beyond 2 R vir, the bulk having been released at redshifts 5 <~ z <~ 8 by early star formation and outflows. In the CGM, lower overdensities are typically enriched by "older," colder metals. Heavy elements are accreted onto ErisMC along filaments via low-metallicity cold inflows and are ejected hot via galactic outflows at a few hundred km s-1. The outflow mass-loading factor is of order unity for the main halo, but can exceed a value of 10 for nearby dwarfs. We stress that our "zoom-in" simulation focuses on the CGM of a single massive system and cannot describe the enrichment history of the intergalactic medium as a whole by a population of galaxies with different masses and star formation histories.},

	Abstract = {The hosts of luminous z ~ 2 quasars evolve into today's massive elliptical galaxies. Current theories predict that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of these massive, dark matter halos (M DM ~ 1012.5 M &sun;) should be dominated by a T ~ 107 K virialized plasma. We test this hypothesis with observations of 74 close-projected quasar pairs, using spectra of the background QSO to characterize the CGM of the foreground one. Surprisingly, our measurements reveal a cool (T ≈ 104 K), massive (M CGM > 1010 M &sun;), and metal-enriched (Z >~ 0.1 Z &sun;) medium extending to at least the expected virial radius (r vir = 160 kpc). The average equivalent widths of H I Lyalpha (\bar{W}_Ly\alpha = 2.1 +/- 0.15 {\AA} for impact parameters R  < 200 kpc) and C II 1334 (\bar{W}_{1334} = 0.7 +/- 0.1) exceed the corresponding CGM measurements of these transitions from all galaxy populations studied previously. Furthermore, we conservatively estimate that the quasar CGM has a 64+6 -7% covering fraction of optically thick gas (N H I  > 1017.2 cm-2) within r vir; this covering factor is twice that of the contemporaneous Lyman break galaxy population. This unexpected reservoir of cool gas is rarely detected "down-the-barrel" to quasars, and hence it is likely that our background sight lines intercept gas that is shadowed from the quasar ionizing radiation by the same obscuring medium often invoked in models of active galactic nucleus unification. Because the high-z halos inhabited by quasars predate modern groups and clusters, these observations are also relevant to the formation and enrichment history of the intragroup/intracluster medium.},

	Abstract = {We examine the Mg II absorbing circumgalactic medium (CGM) for the 182 intermediate redshift (0.072 <= z <= 1.120) galaxies in the "Mg II Absorber-Galaxy Catalog" (MAGIICAT). We parameterize the anti-correlation between equivalent width, Wr (2796), and impact parameter, D, with a log-linear fit, and show that a power law poorly describes the data. We find that higher luminosity galaxies have larger Wr (2796) at larger D (4.3sigma). The covering fractions, fc , decrease with increasing D and Wr (2796) detection threshold. Higher luminosity galaxies have larger fc ; no absorption is detected in lower luminosity galaxies beyond 100 kpc. Bluer and redder galaxies have similar fc for D < 100 kpc, but for D > 100 kpc, bluer galaxies have larger fc , as do higher redshift galaxies. The "absorption radius," R(L) = R *(L/L*)beta, which we examine for four different Wr (2796) detection thresholds, is more luminosity sensitive to the B-band than the K-band, more sensitive for redder galaxies than for bluer galaxies, and does not evolve with redshift for the K-band, but becomes more luminosity sensitive toward lower redshift for the B-band. These trends clearly indicate a more extended Mg II absorbing CGM around higher luminosity, bluer, and higher redshift galaxies. Several of our findings are in conflict with other works. We address these conflicts and discuss the implications of our results for the low-ionization, intermediate redshift CGM.},

@article{schawinski2014,
	Abstract = {We use SDSS+GALEX+Galaxy Zoo data to study the quenching of star formation in low-redshift galaxies. We show that the green valley between the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which most blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes morphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue early-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies are transformed from disc to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly. In contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant discs, and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates decline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these conclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a striking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms of the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that late-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of gas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion of the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental processes. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas supply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid quenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disc to spheroid. This gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger, which in most cases transforms galaxies from disc to elliptical morphology, and mergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly active galactic nuclei feedback.},

	Abstract = {We report results from a survey of Mg II absorbers in the spectra of background quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) that are within close angular distances to a foreground galaxy at z < 0.5, using the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph. We have established a spectroscopic sample of 94 galaxies at a median redshift of langzrang = 0.24 in fields around 70 distant background QSOs (z QSO > 0.6), 71 of which are in an "isolated" environment with no known companions and located at rho <~ 120 h -1 kpc from the line of sight of a background QSO. The rest-frame absolute B-band magnitudes span a range from MB - 5log h = -16.4 to MB - 5log h = -21.4 and rest-frame BAB - RAB colors range from BAB - RAB ≈ 0 to BAB - RAB ≈ 1.5. Of these "isolated" galaxies, we find that 47 have corresponding Mg II absorbers in the spectra of background QSOs and rest-frame absorption equivalent width Wr (2796) = 0.1-2.34 {\AA}, and 24 do not give rise to Mg II absorption to sensitive upper limits. Our analysis shows that (1) Wr (2796) declines with increasing distance from "isolated" galaxies but shows no clear trend in "group" environments; (2) more luminous galaxies possess more extended Mg II absorbing halos with the gaseous radius scaled by B-band luminosity according to R gas = 75 × (LB /L  B * )(0.35 $\pm$ 0.03) h -1 kpc; (3) there is little dependence between the observed absorber strength and galaxy intrinsic colors; and (4) within R gas, we find a mean covering fraction of langkappa0.3rang ≈ 70% for absorbers of Wr (2796) >= 0.3 {\AA} and langkappa0.1rang ≈ 80% for absorbers of Wr (2796) >= 0.1 {\AA}. The results confirm that extended Mg II absorbing halos are a common and generic feature around ordinary galaxies and that the gaseous radius is a fixed fraction of the dark matter halo radius. The lack of correlation between Wr (2796) strength and galaxy colors suggests a lack of physical connection between the origin of extended Mg II halos and recent star formation history of the galaxies. Finally, we discuss the total gas mass in galactic halos as traced by Mg II absorbers. We also compare our results with previous studies.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	Abstract = {We study the connections between ongoing star formation, galaxy mass, and extended halo gas, in order to distinguish between starburst-driven outflows and infalling clouds that produce the majority of observed Mg II absorbers at large galactic radii (gsim10 h -1 kpc) and to gain insights into halo gas contents around galaxies. We present new measurements of total stellar mass (M star), Halpha emission line strength (EW(Halpha)), and specific star formation rate (sSFR) for the 94 galaxies described by Chen et al.'s 2010 paper. We find that the extent of Mg II absorbing gas, R_{Mg II}, scales with M star and sSFR, following R_{Mg II}∝ M_star^{0.28}× sSFR^{0.11}. The strong dependence of R_{Mg II} on M star is most naturally explained, if more massive galaxies possess more extended halos of cool gas and the observed Mg II absorbers arise in infalling clouds which will subsequently fuel star formation in the galaxies. The additional scaling relation of R_{Mg II} with sSFR can be understood either as accounting for extra gas supplies due to starburst outflows or as correcting for suppressed cool gas content in high-mass halos. The latter is motivated by the well-known sSFR-M star inverse correlation in field galaxies. Our analysis shows that a joint study of galaxies and Mg II absorbers along common sight lines provides an empirical characterization of halo gaseous radius versus halo mass. A comparison study of R_{Mg II} around red- and blue-sequence galaxies may provide the first empirical constraint for resolving the physical origin of the observed sSFR-M star relation in galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The size and mass of two circumgalactic medium (CGM) clouds in the halo (impact parameter = 65 kpc) of a nearby late-type galaxy, MGC-01-04-005 ({cz}=1865 {km} {{{s}}}-1), are investigated using a close triplet of QSO sight lines (the ``LBQS Triplet''). Far ultraviolet spectra obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope find two velocity components in {Ly}alpha  at ˜1830 and 1900 {km} {{{s}}}-1 in two of these sight lines, requiring minimum transverse cloud sizes of >=slant 10 kpc. A plausible, but not conclusive, detection of C iv 1548 {\AA} absorption at the higher velocity in the third sight line suggests an even larger lower limit of >=slant 23 kpc for that cloud. Using various combinations of constraints, including photoionization modeling for one absorber, lower limits on masses of these two clouds of ≳ {10}6{M}&sun;  are obtained. Ground-based imaging and long-slit spectroscopy of MCG-01-04-005 obtained at the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope find it to be a relatively normal late-type galaxy with a current star formation rate (SFR) of ˜ 0.01{M}&sun;  {{yr}}-1. GALEX photometry finds an SFR only a few times higher over the last 108 years. We conclude that the CGM clouds probed by these spectra are typical because they are at impact parameters of 0.4-0.5 {R}{vir} from a rather typical, non-starbursting late-type galaxy; thus, these size and mass results should be generic for this class. Therefore, at least some CGM clouds are exceptionally large and massive.},

	Abstract = {Galactic feedback strongly affects the way galactic environments are enriched. We examine this connection by performing a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, exploring a range of parameters based on the galaxy formation model developed in Vogelsberger et al. We examine the effects of AGN feedback, wind mass loading, wind specific energy, and wind metal-loading on the properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies with Mhalo > 1011 M&sun;. Note that while the V13 model was tuned to match observations including the stellar mass function, no explicit tuning was done for the CGM. The wind energy per unit outflow mass has the most significant effect on the CGM enrichment. High-energy winds launch metals far beyond the virial radius. AGN feedback also has a significant effect, but only at z < 3. We compare to high-redshift HI and CIV observations. All our simulations produce the observed number of Damped Lyman alpha Absorbers. At lower column density, several of our simulations produce enough Lyman Limit Systems (LLS) 100 kpc from the galaxy, but in all cases the LLS abundance falls off with distance faster than observations, with too few LLS at 200 kpc. Further, in all models the CIV abundance drops off too sharply with distance, with too little CIV 100-200 kpc from the galaxy. Higher energy wind models produce more extended CIV but also produce less stars, in tension with star formation rate density observations. This highlights the fact that circumgalactic observations are a strong constraint on galactic feedback models.},

	Abstract = {We analyze new far-ultraviolet spectra of 13 quasars from the z~ 0.2 COS-Halos survey that cover the H i Lyman limit of 14 circumgalactic medium (CGM) systems. These data yield precise estimates or more constraining limits than previous COS-Halos measurements on the H i column densities {N}{{H}{{I}}}. We then apply a Monte-Carlo Markov chain approach on 32 systems from COS-Halos to estimate the metallicity of the cool (T~ {10}4 K) CGM gas that gives rise to low-ionization state metal lines, under the assumption of photoionization equilibrium with the extragalactic UV background. The principle results are: (1) the CGM of field L* galaxies exhibits a declining H i surface density with impact parameter {R}\perp  (at > 99.5 %  confidence), (2) the transmission of ionizing radiation through CGM gas alone is 70 $\pm$ 7% (3) the metallicity distribution function of the cool CGM is unimodal with a median of {10}-0.51 {Z}o  and a 95% interval ≈ 1/50 {Z}o  to > 3 {Z}o ; the incidence of metal-poor (< 1/100 {Z}o ) gas is low, implying any such gas discovered along quasar sightlines is typically unrelated to L* galaxies; (4) we find an unexpected increase in gas metallicity with declining {N}{{H}{{I}}} (at > 99.9 %  confidence) and, therefore, also with increasing {R}\perp ; the high metallicity at large radii implies early enrichment; and (5) a non-parametric estimate of the cool CGM gas mass is {M}{CGM}{cool}=(9.2+/- 4.3)× {10}10 {M}o , which together with new mass estimates for the hot CGM may resolve the galactic missing baryons problem. Future analyses of halo gas should focus on the underlying astrophysics governing the CGM, rather than processes that simply expel the medium from the halo.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 13033 and 11598.},

	Abstract = {We describe the redmonster automated redshift measurement and spectral classification software designed for the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). We describe the algorithms, the template standard and requirements, and the newly developed galaxy templates to be used on eBOSS spectra. We present results from testing on early data from eBOSS, where we have found a 90.5% automated redshift and spectral classification success rate for the luminous red galaxy sample (redshifts 0.6 ≲ z ≲ 1.0). The redmonster performance meets the eBOSS cosmology requirements for redshift classification and catastrophic failures and represents a significant improvement over the previous pipeline. We describe the empirical processes used to determine the optimum number of additive polynomial terms in our models and an acceptable {{Delta }}{chi }r2 threshold for declaring statistical confidence. Statistical errors on redshift measurement due to photon shot noise are assessed, and we find typical values of a few tens of km s-1. An investigation of redshift differences in repeat observations scaled by error estimates yields a distribution with a Gaussian mean and standard deviation of mu ˜ 0.01 and sigma ˜ 0.65, respectively, suggesting the reported statistical redshift uncertainties are over-estimated by ˜54%. We assess the effects of object magnitude, signal-to-noise ratio, fiber number, and fiber head location on the pipeline's redshift success rate. Finally, we describe directions of ongoing development.},

	Abstract = {We have undertaken a deep, wide-field H I imaging survey of M31, reaching a maximum resolution of about 50 pc and 2 km s-1 across a 95 × 48 kpc region. The H I mass and brightness sensitivity at 100 pc resolution for a 25 km s-1 wide spectral feature is 1500 M sun and 0.28 K. Our study reveals ubiquitous H I self-opacity features, discernible in the first instance as filamentary local minima in images of the peak H I brightness temperature. Local minima are organized into complexes of more than kpc length and are particularly associated with the leading edge of spiral arm features. Just as in the Galaxy, there is only patchy correspondence of self-opaque features with CO(1-0) emission. We have produced images of the best-fit physical parameters: spin temperature, opacity-corrected column density, and nonthermal velocity dispersion, for the brightest spectral feature along each line of sight in the M31 disk. Spectroscopically opaque atomic gas is organized into filamentary complexes and isolated clouds down to 100 pc. Localized opacity corrections to the column density exceed an order of magnitude in many cases and add globally to a 30% increase in the atomic gas mass over that inferred from the integrated brightness under the usual assumption of negligible self-opacity. Opaque atomic gas first increases from 20 to 60 K in spin temperature with radius to 12 kpc but then declines again to 20 K beyond 25 kpc. We have extended the resolved star formation law down to physical scales more than an order of magnitude smaller in area and mass than has been possible previously. The relation between total gas mass and star formation rate density is significantly tighter than that with molecular mass and is fully consistent in both slope and normalization with the power-law index of 1.56 found in the molecule-dominated disk of M51 at 500 pc resolution. Below a gas mass density of about 5 M sun pc-2, there is a downturn in star formation rate density which may represent a real local threshold for massive star formation at a cloud mass of about 5 × 104 M sun.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Stellar mass distribution in the Andromeda galaxy (M 31) is estimated using optical and near-infrared imaging data. Combining the derived stellar mass model with various kinematical data, properties of the dark matter (DM) halo of the galaxy are constrained.  Methods: SDSS observations through the ugriz filters and the Spitzer imaging at 3.6 microns are used to sample the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galaxy at each imaging pixel. Intrinsic dust extinction effects are taken into account by using far-infrared observations. Synthetic SEDs created with different stellar population synthesis models are fitted to the observed SEDs, providing estimates for the stellar mass surface density at each pixel. The stellar mass distribution of the galaxy is described with a 3-dimensional model consisting of a nucleus, a bulge, a disc, a young disc and a halo component, each following the Einasto density distribution (relations between different functional forms of the Einasto density distribution are given in Appendix B). By comparing the stellar mass distribution to the observed rotation curve and kinematics of outer globular clusters and satellite galaxies, the DM halo parameters are estimated.  Results: Stellar population synthesis models suggest that M 31 is dominated by old (≳7 Gyr) stars throughout the galaxy, with the lower limit for the stellar mass-to-light ratios M/Lr ≳ 4 M&sun;/L&sun;. The upper limit M/Lr ≲ 6 M&sun;/L&sun; is given by the rotation curve of the galaxy. The total stellar mass is (10-15) × 1010 M&sun;, 30% of which is in the bulge and 56% in the disc. None of the tested DM distribution models (Einasto, NFW, Moore, Burkert) can be falsified on the basis of the stellar matter distribution and the rotation curve of the galaxy. The virial mass M200 of the DM halo is (0.8-1.1) × 1012 M&sun; and the virial radius is R200 = 189-213 kpc, depending on the DM distribution. For the Einasto profile, the average density of the DM halo within the central 10 pc is 16-61 M&sun; pc-3 (0.6-2.3 TeV/c2 cm-3), depending on the stellar mass model. The central density of the DM halo is comparable to that of nearby dwarf galaxies, low-surface-brightness galaxies and distant massive disc galaxies, thus the evolution of central DM halo properties seems to be regulated by similar processes for a broad range of halo masses, environments, and cosmological epochs.},

	Abstract = {We present new quasars discovered in the vicinity of the Andromeda and Triangulum galaxies with the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, also named the Guoshoujing Telescope, during the 2010 and 2011 observational seasons. Quasar candidates are selected based on the available Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Kitt Peak National Observatory 4 m telescope, Xuyi Schmidt Telescope Photometric Survey optical, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer near-infrared photometric data. We present 509 new quasars discovered in a stripe of ~135 deg2 from M31 to M33 along the Giant Stellar Stream in the 2011 pilot survey data sets, and also 17 new quasars discovered in an area of ~100 deg2 that covers the central region and the southeastern halo of M31 in the 2010 commissioning data sets. These 526 new quasars have i magnitudes ranging from 15.5 to 20.0, redshifts from 0.1 to 3.2. They represent a significant increase of the number of identified quasars in the vicinity of M31 and M33. There are now 26, 62, and 139 known quasars in this region of the sky with i magnitudes brighter than 17.0, 17.5, and 18.0, respectively, of which 5, 20, and 75 are newly discovered. These bright quasars provide an invaluable collection with which to probe the kinematics and chemistry of the interstellar/intergalactic medium in the Local Group of galaxies. A total of 93 quasars are now known with locations within 2.$\,^{\circ}$5 of M31, of which 73 are newly discovered. Tens of quasars are now known to be located behind the Giant Stellar Stream, and hundreds are behind the extended halo and its associated substructures of M31. The much enlarged sample of known quasars in the vicinity of M31 and M33 can potentially be utilized to construct a perfect astrometric reference frame to measure the minute proper motions (PMs) of M31 and M33, along with the PMs of substructures associated with the Local Group of galaxies. Those PMs are some of the most fundamental properties of the Local Group.},

	Abstract = {We present a Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer survey of highly ionized high-velocity clouds (HVCs) in 66 extragalactic sight lines with (S/N)1030>8. We search the spectra for high-velocity (100 km s-1<|vLSR|<400 km s-1) O VI absorption and find a total of 63 absorbers, 16 with 21 cm emitting H I counterparts and 47 ``highly ionized'' absorbers without 21 cm emission. The highly ionized HVC population is characterized by <b(O VI)>=38+/-10 km s-1 and <logNa(O VI)>=13.83+/-0.36, with negative-velocity clouds generally found at l<180deg and positive-velocity clouds found at l>180deg. Eleven of these highly ionized HVCs are positive-velocity wings (broad O VI features extending asymmetrically to velocities of up to 300 km s-1). We find that 81% (30 of 37) of highly ionized HVCs have clear accompanying C III absorption, and 76% (29 of 38) have accompanying H I absorption in the Lyman series. We present the first (O VI selected) sample of C III and H  I absorption line HVCs and find <b(C III)>=30+/-8 km s-1, logNa(C III) ranges from <12.5 to >14.4, <b(H I)>=22+/-5 km s-1, and log Na(H I) ranges from <14.7 to >16.9. The lower average width of the high-velocity H I absorbers implies the H I  lines arise in a separate, lower temperature phase than the O VI. The ratio Na(C III)/Na(O VI) is generally constant with velocity in highly ionized HVCs, suggesting that at least some C III resides in the same gas as the O VI. Collisional ionization equilibrium models with solar abundances can explain the O VI/C III ratios for temperatures near 1.7×105 K; nonequilibrium models with the O VI ``frozen in'' at lower temperatures are also possible. Photoionization models are not viable since they underpredict O VI by several orders of magnitude. The presence of associated C III and H I strongly suggests the highly ionized HVCs are not formed in the hotter plasma that gives rise to O VII and O VIII X-ray absorption. We find that the shape of the O VI positive-velocity wing profiles is well reproduced by a radiatively cooling, vertical outflow moving with ballistic dynamics, with T0=106 K, n0~2×10-3 cm-3, and v0~250 km s-1. However, the outflow has to be patchy and out of ionization equilibrium to explain the sky distribution and the simultaneous presence of O VI, C III, and H I. We found that a spherical outflow can produce high-velocity O VI components (as opposed to the wings), showing that the possible range of outflow model results is too broad to conclusively identify whether or not an outflow has left its signature in the data. An alternative model, supported by the similar multiphase structure and similar O VI properties of highly ionized and 21 cm HVCs, is one where the highly ionized HVCs represent the low N(H  I) tail of the HVC population, with the O VI formed at the interfaces around the embedded H I cores. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that some highly ionized HVCs exist in the Local Group or beyond, we favor a Galactic origin. This is based on the recent evidence that both H I HVCs and the million-degree gas detected in X-ray absorption are Galactic phenomena. Since the highly ionized HVCs appear to trace the interface between these two Galactic phases, it follows that highly ionized HVCs are Galactic themselves. However, the nondetection of high-velocity O VI in halo star spectra implies that any Galactic high-velocity O VI exists at z distances beyond a few kpc.},

We investigate gas loss processes in the smallest satellites of the MW using three-dimensional, high-resolution, idealized wind tunnel simulations, accounting for gas loss through both ram pressure stripping and expulsion by supernova feedback. Using initial conditions appropriate for a dwarf galaxy like Leo T, we investigate whether or not environmental gas stripping and internal feedback can quench these low-mass galaxies on the expected timescales, shorter than 2 Gyr. We find that supernova feedback contributes negligibly to the stripping rate for these low star formation rate galaxies. However, we also find that RPS is less efficient than expected in the stripping scenarios we consider. Our work suggests that although RPS can eventually completely strip these galaxies, other physics is likely at play to reconcile our computed stripping times with the rapid quenching timescales deduced from observations of low-mass MW dwarf galaxies. We discuss the roles additional physics may play in this scenario, including host-satellite tidal interactions, cored versus cuspy dark matter profiles, reionization, and satellite preprocessing. We conclude that a proper accounting of these physics together is necessary to understand the quenching of low-mass MW satellites.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological simulations and theories of galaxy formation predict that the Milky Way should be embedded in an extended hot gaseous halo or corona. To date, a definitive detection of such a corona in the Milky Way remains elusive. We have attempted to estimate the density of the Milky Way's cosmological corona using the effect that it has on the surrounding population of dwarf galaxies. We have considered two dSphs close to the Galaxy: Sextans and Carina. Assuming that they have lost all their gas during the last pericentric passage via ram-pressure stripping, we were able to estimate the average density (n ˜ 2 s 10-4 cm-3) of the corona at a distance of ˜ 70 kpc from the Milky Way. If we consider an isothermal profile and extrapolate it at large radii, the corona could contain a significant fraction of the missing baryons associated to the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {We examine the properties of atomic hydrogen (H I) associated with galaxies in the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations of galaxy formation. EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce the stellar mass function and galaxy sizes at z = 0.1, and we assess whether this calibration also yields realistic H I properties. We estimate the self-shielding density with a fitting function calibrated using radiation transport simulations, and correct for molecular hydrogen with empirical or theoretical relations. The `standard-resolution' simulations systematically underestimate H I column densities, leading to an H I deficiency in low-mass (M* < 1010 M&sun;) galaxies and poor reproduction of the observed H I mass function. These shortcomings are largely absent from EAGLE simulations featuring a factor of 8 (2) better mass (spatial) resolution, within which the H I mass of galaxies evolves more mildly from z = 1 to 0 than in the standard-resolution simulations. The largest volume simulation reproduces the observed clustering of H I systems, and its dependence on H I richness. At fixed M*, galaxies acquire more H I in simulations with stronger feedback, as they become associated with more massive haloes and higher infall rates. They acquire less H I in simulations with a greater star formation efficiency, since the star formation and feedback necessary to balance the infall rate is produced by smaller gas reservoirs. The simulations indicate that the H I of present-day galaxies was acquired primarily by the smooth accretion of ionized, intergalactic gas at z ~= 1, which later self-shields, and that only a small fraction is contributed by the reincorporation of gas previously heated strongly by feedback. H I reservoirs are highly dynamic: over 40 per cent of H I associated with z = 0.1 galaxies is converted to stars or ejected by z = 0.},

	Abstract = {We report new observations from a systematic, spectroscopic, ultraviolet absorption-line survey that maps the spatial and kinematic properties of the high velocity gas in the Galactic Center (GC) region. We examine the hypothesis that this gas traces the biconical nuclear outflow. We use an ultraviolet spectra of 47 background QSOs and halo stars projected inside and outside the northern Fermi Bubble from the Hubble Space Telescope to study the incidence of high velocity absorption around it. We use five lines of sight inside the northern Fermi Bubble to constrain the velocity and column densities of outflowing gas traced by O i, Al ii, C ii, C iv, Si ii, Si iii, Si iv, and other species. We find that all five lines of sight inside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high velocity absorption components, whereas only 9 out of the 42 lines of sight outside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high velocity absorption components. The observed outflow velocity profile decreases with Galactic latitude and radial distance (R) from the GC. The observed blueshifted velocities change from {v}{GSR}=-265 {km} {{{s}}}-1 at R ≈ 2.3 kpc to {v}{GSR}=-91 {km} {{{s}}}-1 at R ≈ 6.5 kpc. We derive the metallicity of the entrained gas along the 1H1613-097 sightline, one that passes through the center of the northern Fermi Bubble, finding [O/H] ≳ -0.54 $\pm$ 0.15. A simple kinematic model, tuned to match the observed absorption component velocities along the five lines of sight inside the Bubble, constrains the outflow velocities to ≈1000--1300 {km} {{{s}}}-1, and the age of the outflow to be ~6--9 Myr. We estimate a minimum mass outflow rate for the nuclear outflow to be ≳ 0.2{M}o  {{yr}}-1. Combining the age and mass outflow rates, we determine a minimum mass of total UV-absorbing cool gas entrained in the Fermi Bubbles to be ≳ 2×  {10}6 {M}o .},

	Abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with stellar feedback from the FIRE project to study the physical nature of Lyman limit systems (LLSs) at z<1. At these low redshifts, LLSs are closely associated with dense gas structures surrounding galaxies, such as galactic winds, dwarf satellites, and cool inflows from the intergalactic medium. Our analysis is based on 14 zoom-in simulations covering the halo mass range M_h~10^9-10^13 Msun at z=0, which we convolve with the dark matter halo mass function to produce cosmological statistics. We find that the majority of cosmologically-selected LLSs are associated with halos in the mass range 10^10 < M_h < 10^12 Msun. The incidence and HI column density distribution of simulated absorbers with columns 10^16.2 < N_HI < 2x10^20 cm^-2 are consistent with observations. High-velocity outflows (with radial velocity exceeding the halo circular velocity by a factor >~2) tend to have higher metallicities ([X/H] ~ -0.5) while very low metallicity ([X/H] < -2) LLSs are typically associated with gas infalling from the intergalactic medium. However, most LLSs occupy an intermediate region in metallicity-radial velocity space, for which there is no clear trend between metallicity and radial kinematics. Metal-enriched inflows arise in the FIRE simulations as a result of galactic winds that fall back onto galaxies at low redshift. The overall simulated LLS metallicity distribution has a mean (standard deviation) [X/H] = -0.9 (0.4) and does not show significant evidence for bimodality, in contrast to recent observational studies but consistent with LLSs arising from halos with a broad range of masses and metallicities.},

	Abstract = {We use cosmological simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project to study the baryon cycle and galaxy mass assembly for central galaxies in the halo mass range $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{10} - 10^{13} M_{\odot}$. By tracing cosmic inflows, galactic outflows, gas recycling, and merger histories, we quantify the contribution of physically distinct sources of material to galaxy growth. We show that in situ star formation fueled by fresh accretion dominates the early growth of galaxies of all masses, while the re-accretion of gas previously ejected in galactic winds often dominates the gas supply for a large portion of every galaxy's evolution. Externally processed material contributes increasingly to the growth of central galaxies at lower redshifts. This includes stars formed ex situ and gas delivered by mergers, as well as smooth intergalactic transfer of gas from other galaxies, an important but previously under-appreciated growth mode. By $z=0$, wind transfer, i.e. the exchange of gas between galaxies via winds, can dominate gas accretion onto $\sim L^{*}$ galaxies over fresh accretion and standard wind recycling. Galaxies of all masses re-accrete >50% of the gas ejected in winds and recurrent recycling is common. The total mass deposited in the intergalactic medium per unit stellar mass formed increases in lower mass galaxies. Re-accretion of wind ejecta occurs over a broad range of timescales, with median recycling times ($\sim 100-350$ Myr) shorter than previously found. Wind recycling typically occurs at the scale radius of the halo, independent of halo mass and redshift, suggesting a characteristic recycling zone around galaxies that scales with the size of the inner halo and the galaxy's stellar component.},

@article{dopita2013,
	Abstract = {Recently, Nicholls et al., inspired by in situ observations of solar system astrophysical plasmas, suggested that the electrons in H II regions are characterized by a kappa-distribution of energies rather than a simple Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Here, we have collected together new atomic data within a modified photoionization code to explore the effects of both the new atomic data and the kappa-distribution on the strong-line techniques used to determine chemical abundances in H II regions. By comparing the recombination temperatures (T rec) with the forbidden line temperatures (T FL), we conclude that kappa ~ 20. While representing only a mild deviation from equilibrium, this result is sufficient to strongly influence abundances determined using methods that depend on measurements of the electron temperature from forbidden lines. We present a number of new emission line ratio diagnostics that cleanly separate the two parameters determining the optical spectrum of H II regions---the ionization parameter q or \cal {U} and the chemical abundance, 12+log(O/H). An automated code to extract these parameters is presented. Using the homogeneous data set from van Zee et al., we find self-consistent results between all of these different diagnostics. The systematic errors between different line ratio diagnostics are much smaller than those found in the earlier strong-line work. Overall, the effect of the kappa-distribution on the strong-line abundances derived solely on the basis of theoretical models is rather small.},

	Abstract = {We compare the properties of gas flows on both the near and far side of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk using Hubble Space Telescope UV absorption-line observations toward an active galactic nucleus behind (transverse) and a star within (down-the-barrel) the LMC disk at an impact parameter of 3.2 {kpc}. We find that even in this relatively quiescent region gas flows away from the disk at speeds up to ˜ 100 {km} {{{s}}}-1 in broad and symmetrical absorption in the low and high ions. The symmetric absorption profiles combined with previous surveys showing little evidence that the ejected gas returns to the LMC and provide compelling evidence that the LMC drives a global, large-scale outflow across its disk, which is the likely result of a recent burst of star formation in the LMC. We find that the outflowing gas is multiphase, ionized by both photoionization (Si ii and Si iii) and collisional ionization (Si iv and C iv). We estimate a total mass and outflow rate to be ≳ {10}7 {M}&sun;  and ≳ \quad 0.4 {M}&sun;  {{yr}}-1. Since the velocity of this large-scale outflow does not reach the LMC escape velocity, the gas removal is likely aided by either ram-pressure stripping with the Milky Way (MW) halo or tidal interactions with the surrounding galaxies, implying that the environment of LMC-like or dwarf galaxies plays an important role in their ultimate gas starvation. Finally we reassess the mass and plausible origins of the high-velocity complex toward the LMC given its newly determined distance that places it in the lower MW halo and sky-coverage that shows it extends well beyond the LMC disk.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under NASA contract No. NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We use the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive of ultraviolet (UV) quasar spectroscopy to conduct the first blind survey for damped Lyalpha absorbers (DLAs) at low redshift (z\lt 1.6). Our statistical sample includes 463 quasars with spectral coverage spanning a total redshift path {{Delta }}z=123.3 or an absorption path {{Delta }}X=229.7. Within this survey path, we identify 4 DLAs defined as absorbers with H i column density {N}{{H}{{I}}} >=slant  {10}20.3 cm-2, which implies an incidence per absorption length {{\ell }}{{DLA}}(X) = {0.017}-0.008+0.014 at a median survey path redshift of z = 0.623. While our estimate of {{\ell }}{{DLA}}(X) is lower than earlier estimates at z≈ 0 from H i 21 cm emission studies, the results are consistent within the measurement uncertainties. Our data set is too small to properly sample the {N}{{H}{{I}}} frequency distribution function f({N}{{H}{{I}}},X), but the observed distribution agrees with previous estimates at z\gt 2. Adopting the z\gt 2 shape of f({N}{{H}{{I}}},X), we infer an H i mass density at z˜ 0.6 of {rho }{{H} {{I}}}{{DLA}} = {0.25}-0.12+0.20× {10}8{M}&sun;  {{{Mpc}}}-3. This is significantly lower than previous estimates from targeted DLA surveys with the HST, but consistent with results from low-z H i 21 cm observations, and suggests that the neutral gas density of the universe has been decreasing over the past 10 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the metallicity distribution of the dense circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies at 0.1 ≲ z ≲ 1.1 as probed by partial Lyman limit systems (pLLSs, 16.1 < log {N}{{H}{{I}}} < 17.2) and LLSs (17.2 <= log {N}{{H}{{I}}} < 17.7 in our sample). The new H i-selected sample, drawn from our Hubble Space Telescope COS G140L snapshot survey of 61 QSOs, has 20 pLLSs and 10 LLSs. Combined with our previous survey, we have a total of 44 pLLSs and 11 LLSs. We find that the metallicity distribution of the pLLSs is bimodal at z ≲ 1, with a minimum at [X/H] = -1. The low-metallicity peak comprises (57 $\pm$ 8)% of the pLLSs and is centered at [X/H] ~= -1.87(1.3% solar metallicity), while the high-metallicity peak is centered at [X/H] ~= -0.32 (48% solar metallicity). Although the sample of LLSs is still small, there is some evidence that the metallicity distributions of the LLSs and pLLSs are different, with a far lower fraction of very metal-poor ([X/H] < -1.4) LLSs than pLLSs. The fraction of LLSs with [X/H] < -1 is similar to that found in pLLSs (~56%). However, higher H i column density absorbers (log {N}{{H}{{I}}} > 19.0) show a much lower fraction of metal-poor gas; therefore, the metallicity distribution of gas in and around galaxies depends sensitively on N H i  at z ≲ 1. We interpret the high-metallicity ([X/H] >= -1) pLLSs and LLSs as arising in outflows, recycling winds, and tidally stripped gas around galaxies. The low-metallicity pLLSs and LLSs imply that the CGM of z ≲ 1 galaxies hosts a substantial mass of cool, dense, low-metallicity gas that may ultimately accrete onto the galaxies.},

@article{stern2016,
	Abstract = {We develop a new method to constrain the physical conditions in the cool (~104 K) circumgalactic medium (CGM) from measurements of ionic column densities by assuming that the cool CGM spans a large range of gas densities and that small high-density clouds are hierarchically embedded in large low-density clouds. The new method combines the information available from different sightlines during the photoionization modeling, thus yielding tighter constraints on CGM properties compared to traditional methods that model each sightline individually. Applying this new technique to the COS Halos survey of low-redshift ~L* galaxies, we find that we can reproduce all observed ion columns in all 44 galaxies in the sample, from the low ions to {{O}} {{VI}}, with a single universal density structure for the cool CGM. The gas densities span the range 50≲ rho /{\bar{rho }}b≲ 5× {10}5 ({\bar{rho }}b is the cosmic mean), while the physical size of individual clouds scales as ~rho -1, from ≈35 kpc for the low-density {{O}} {{VI}} clouds to ≈6 pc for the highest-density low-ion clouds. The deduced cloud sizes are too small for this density structure to be driven by self-gravity; thus, its physical origin is unclear. The implied cool CGM mass within the virial radius is (1.3 $\pm$ 0.4) × 1010  {M}o  (~1% of the halo mass), distributed rather uniformly over the 4 decades in density. The mean cool gas density profile scales as {R}-1.0+/- 0.3, where R is the distance from the galaxy center. We construct a 3D model of the cool CGM based on our results, which we argue provides a benchmark for the CGM structure in hydrodynamic simulations. Our results can be tested by measuring the coherence scales of different ions.},

	Abstract = {We study the hot and cold circum-galactic medium (CGM) of 86 galaxies of the cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation suite NIHAO. NIHAO allows a study of how the z = 0 CGM varies across 5 orders of magnitude of stellar mass using OVI and HI as proxies for hot and cold gas. The cool HI covering fraction and column density profiles match observations well, particularly in the inner CGM. OVI shows increasing column densities with mass, a trend seemingly echoed in the observations. As in multiple previous simulations, the OVI column densities in simulations are lower than observed and optically thick HI does not extend as far out as in observations. We take a look at the collisional ionisation fraction of OVI as a function of halo mass. We make observable predictions of the bipolarity of outflows and their effect on the general shape of the CGM. Bipolar outflows can be seen out to around 40 kpc in intermediate and low mass halos (MHalo < 1011 M&sun;), but outside that radius, the CGM is too well mixed to detect an elongated shape. Larger halos have extended gas discs beyond the stellar disc that dominate the shape of the inner CGM. The simulated CGM is remarkably spherical even in low mass simulations. The chemical enrichment of both halo and disc gas follow expected increasing trends as a function of halo mass that are well fit with power laws. These relations can be used in non-hydrodynamic models, such as semi-analytic models.},

@article{cameron2011,
	Abstract = {I present a critical review of techniques for estimating confidence intervals on binomial population proportions inferred from success counts in small to intermediate samples. Population proportions arise frequently as quantities of interest in astronomical research; for instance, in studies aiming to constrain the bar fraction, active galactic nucleus fraction, supermassive black hole fraction, merger fraction, or red sequence fraction from counts of galaxies exhibiting distinct morphological features or stellar populations. However, two of the most widely-used techniques for estimating binomial confidence intervals - the `normal approximation' and the Clopper & Pearson approach - are liable to misrepresent the degree of statistical uncertainty present under sampling conditions routinely encountered in astronomical surveys, leading to an ineffective use of the experimental data (and, worse, an inefficient use of the resources expended in obtaining that data). Hence, I provide here an overview of the fundamentals of binomial statistics with two principal aims: (i) to reveal the ease with which (Bayesian) binomial confidence intervals with more satisfactory behaviour may be estimated from the quantiles of the beta distribution using modern mathematical software packages (e.g. r, matlab, mathematica, idl, python); and (ii) to demonstrate convincingly the major flaws of both the `normal approximation' and the Clopper & Pearson approach for error estimation.},

@article{liang2016,
	Abstract = {We analyse circumgalactic medium (CGM) in a suite of high-resolution cosmological re-simulations of a Milky Way size galaxy and show that CGM properties are quite sensitive to details of star formation-feedback loop modelling. The simulation that produces a realistic late-type galaxy, fails to reproduce existing observations of the CGM. In contrast, simulation that does not produce a realistic galaxy has the predicted CGM in better agreement with observations. This illustrates that properties of galaxies and properties of their CGM provide strong complementary constraints on the processes governing galaxy formation. Our simulations predict that column density profiles of ions are well described by an exponential function of projected distance d: N ∝ e^{-d/h_s}. Simulations thus indicate that the sharp drop in absorber detections at larger distances in observations does not correspond to a `boundary' of an ion, but reflects the underlying steep exponential column density profile. Furthermore, we find that ionization energy of ions is tightly correlated with the scaleheight hs: h_s ∝ E_ion^{0.74}. At z ≈ 0, warm gas traced by low-ionization species (e.g. Mg II and C IV) has hs ≈ 0.03 - 0.07Rvir, while higher ionization species (O VI and Ne VIII) have hs ≈ 0.32 - 0.45Rvir. Finally, the scaleheights of ions in our simulations evolve slower than the virial radius for z <= 2, but similarly to the halo scale radius, rs. Thus, we suggest that the column density profiles of galaxies at different redshifts should be scaled by rs rather than the halo virial radius.},

@article{rao2013,
	Abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectra of 10 quasars located behind M31, selected to investigate the properties of gas associated with its extended disc and high-velocity clouds (HVCs). The sightlines have impact parameters ranging between b = 13 and 112 kpc. No absorption is detected in the four sightlines selected to sample any extended disc (or halo) gas that might be present in the outer regions of M31 beyond an impact parameter of b > 57 kpc. Of the six remaining sightlines, all of which lie at b < 32 kpc and within the NHI = 2 × 1018 cm-2 boundary of the H I disc of M31, we detect low-ionization absorption at M31 velocities along four of them (three of which include Mg II absorption). We also detect Mg II absorption from an HVC. This HVC sightline does not pass through the 21 cm disc of M31, but we detect additional Mg II absorption at velocities distinct from the HVC that presumably arises in the halo. We find that along sightlines where both are detected, the velocity location of the low-ion gas tracks the peak in 21 cm emission. High-ionization absorption is detected along the three inner sightlines, but not along the three outer sightlines, for which C IV data exist. As inferred from high-resolution 21 cm emission-line maps of M31's disc and extended regions, only one of the sightlines may be capable of harbouring a damped Lyalpha system, i.e. with NHI >= 2 × 1020 cm-2. This sightline has impact parameter b = 17.5 kpc, and we detect both low- and high-ion absorption lines associated with it. The impact parameters of our observed sightlines through M31 are similar to the impact parameters of galaxies identified with Mg II absorbers at redshifts 0.1 < z < 1.0 in a 2011 study by Rao et al. However, even if we only count cases where absorption due to M31 is detected, the Mg II lambda2796 rest equivalent width values are significantly smaller. In comparison, moderate-to-strong Mg II absorption from Milky Way gas is detected along all 10 sightlines. Thus, this study indicates that M31 does not present itself as an absorbing galaxy which is typical of higher-redshift galaxies inferred to give rise to moderate-strength quasar absorption lines. M31 also appears not to possess an extensive large gaseous cross-section, at least not along the direction of its major axis.},

	Abstract = {We study the gas distribution in the Milky Way and Andromeda using a constrained cosmological simulation of the Local Group (LG) within the context of the CLUES (Constrained Local UniversE Simulations) project. We analyse the properties of gas in the simulated galaxies at z = 0 for three different phases: `cold', `hot' and H I, and compare our results with observations. The amount of material in the hot halo (Mhot ≈ 4-5 × 1010 M&sun;), and the cold (Mcold(r ≲ 10 kpc) ≈ 108 M&sun;) and H I (M_{H I}(r≲ 50 kpc)≈ 3{-}4× 10^8 {M_{&sun;}) components displays reasonable agreement with observations. We also compute the accretion/ejection rates together with the H I (radial and all-sky) covering fractions. The integrated H I accretion rate within r = 50 kpc gives ˜0.2-0.3 M&sun; yr-1, i.e. close to that obtained from high-velocity clouds in the Milky Way. We find that the global accretion rate is dominated by hot material, although ionized gas with T ≲ 105 K can contribute significantly too. The net accretion rates of all material at the virial radii are 6-8 M&sun; yr-1. At z = 0, we find a significant gas excess between the two galaxies, as compared to any other direction, resulting from the overlap of their gaseous haloes. In our simulation, the gas excess first occurs at z ˜ 1, as a result of the kinematical evolution of the LG.}},

With data on more than 23,000 galaxies, it includes all galaxies with apparent diameters larger than one arc minute, magnitudes brighter than about magnitude 15.5, and redshifts not larger than 15,000 km/sec, as well as many other objects of interest. Vol. I contains the explanations and references, Vol. II and III contain the catalogue proper. The catalogue gives for each galaxy its position, names, type and luminosity class, optical diameter and axis ratio, position angle, optical, infrared, and neutral hydrogen magnitudes, optical color indices and surface brightnesses, neutral hydrogen indices and line widths, and radial velocities.},

	Abstract = {Context. A recent discovery of two stellar clusters associated with the diffuse high-latitude cloud HRK 81.4-77.8 has important implications for star formation in the Galactic halo.  Aims: We derive a plausible distance estimate to HRK 81.4-77.8 primarily from its gaseous properties.  Methods: We spatially correlate state-of-the-art HI, far-infrared and soft X-ray data to analyze the diffuse gas in the cloud. The absorption of the soft X-ray emission from the Galactic halo by HRK 81.4-77.8 is used to constrain the distance to the cloud.  Results: HRK 81.4-77.8 is most likely located at an altitude of about 400 pc within the disk-halo interface of the Milky Way Galaxy. The HI data discloses a disbalance in density and pressure between the warm and cold gaseous phases. Apparently, the cold gas is compressed by the warm medium. This disbalance might trigger the formation of molecular gas high above the Galactic plane on pc to sub-pc scales.},

	Abstract = {Context. The subsequent coalescence of low-mass halos over cosmic time is thought to be the major formation channel of massive spiral galaxies like the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy (M 31). The gaseous halo of a massive galaxy is considered to be the reservoir of baryonic matter persistently fueling the star formation in the disk. Because of its proximity, M 31 is the ideal object for studying the structure of the halo gas in great detail.  Aims: Using the latest neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) data of the Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS) allows comprising a comprehensive inventory of gas associated with M 31. The primary aim is to differentiate between physical structures belonging to the Milky Way Galaxy and M 31 and accordingly to test the presence of a M 31 neutral gaseous halo.  Methods: Analyzing the spatially fully sampled EBHIS data makes it feasible to trace coherent HI structures in space and radial velocity. To disentangle Milky Way and M 31 HI emission we use a new approach, along with the traditional path of setting an upper radial velocity limit, by calculating a difference second moment map.  Results: We argue that M 31's disk is physically connected to an asymmetric HI halo of tens of kpc size, the M 31 cloud. We confirm the presence of a coherent low-velocity HI filament located in between M 31 and M 33 aligned at the sky with the clouds at systemic velocity. The physical parameters of the HI filament are comparable to those of the HI clouds at systemic velocity. We also detected an irregularly shaped HI cloud that is is positionally located close to but offset from the stellar body of And XIX.},

@article{nidever2008,
	Abstract = {We explore the Magellanic Stream (MS) using a Gaussian decomposition of the H I velocity profiles in the Leiden-Argentine-Bonn (LAB) all-sky H I survey. This decomposition reveals the MS to be composed of two filaments distinct both spatially (as first pointed out by Putman et al.) and in velocity. Using the velocity coherence of the filaments, one can be traced back to its origin in what we identify as the southeast H I overdensity (SEHO) of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which includes 30 Doradus. Parts of the Leading Arm (LA) can also be traced back to the SEHO in velocity and position. Therefore, at least one-half of the trailing Stream and most of the LA originates in the LMC, contrary to previous assertions that both the MS and the LA originate in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and/or in the Magellanic Bridge. The two MS filaments show strong periodic, undulating spatial and velocity patterns that we speculate are an imprint of the LMC rotation curve. If true, then the drift rate of the Stream gas away from the Magellanic Clouds is ~49 km s-1 and the age of the MS is ~1.74 Gyr. The Staveley-Smith et al. high-resolution H I data of the LMC show gas outflows from supergiant shells in the SEHO that seem to be creating the LA and LMC filament of the MS. Blowout of LMC gas is an effect not previously accounted for but one that probably plays an important role in creating the MS and LA.},

	Abstract = {We present the open-source Python code pyMCZ that determines oxygen abundance and its distribution from strong emission lines in the standard metallicity calibrators, based on the original IDL code of Kewley and Dopita (2002) with updates from Kewley and Ellison (2008), and expanded to include more recently developed calibrators. The standard strong-line diagnostics have been used to estimate the oxygen abundance in the interstellar medium through various emission line ratios (referred to as indicators) in many areas of astrophysics, including galaxy evolution and supernova host galaxy studies. We introduce a Python implementation of these methods that, through Monte Carlo sampling, better characterizes the statistical oxygen abundance confidence region including the effect due to the propagation of observational uncertainties. These uncertainties are likely to dominate the error budget in the case of distant galaxies, hosts of cosmic explosions. Given line flux measurements and their uncertainties, our code produces synthetic distributions for the oxygen abundance in up to 15 metallicity calibrators simultaneously, as well as for E(B- V) , and estimates their median values and their 68% confidence regions. We provide the option of outputting the full Monte Carlo distributions, and their Kernel Density estimates. We test our code on emission line measurements from a sample of nearby supernova host galaxies (z < 0.15) and compare our metallicity results with those from previous methods. We show that our metallicity estimates are consistent with previous methods but yield smaller statistical uncertainties. It should be noted that systematic uncertainties are not taken into account. We also offer visualization tools to assess the spread of the oxygen abundance in the different calibrators, as well as the shape of the estimated oxygen abundance distribution in each calibrator, and develop robust metrics for determining the appropriate Monte Carlo sample size. The code is open access and open source and can be found at https://github.com/nyusngroup/pyMCZ.},

	Abstract = {We have measured the distance to the massive star-forming region W3OH in the Perseus spiral arm of the Milky Way to be 1.95 +/- 0.04 kiloparsecs (5.86 × 1016 km). This distance was determined by triangulation, with Earth's orbit as one segment of a triangle, using the Very Long Baseline Array. This resolves the long-standing problem that there is a discrepancy of a factor of 2 between different techniques used to determine distances. The reason for the discrepancy is that this portion of the Perseus arm has anomalous motions. The orientation of the anomalous motion agrees with spiral density-wave theory, but the magnitude of the motion is somewhat larger than most models predict.},

H I column densities of the DLAs are measured with Voigt profile fits to the Lyalpha profiles, and we find an increased number of false DLA identifications with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at z > 4 due to the increased density of the Lyalpha forest. Ionic column densities are determined using the apparent optical depth method, and we combine our new metallicity measurements with 195 from previous surveys to determine the evolution of the cosmic metallicity of neutral gas. We find the metallicity of DLAs decreases with increasing redshift, improving the significance of the trend and extending it to higher redshifts, with a linear fit of -0.22 $\pm$ 0.03 dex per unit redshift from z = 0.09-5.06. The metallicity "floor" of ≈1/600 solar continues out to z ~ 5, despite our sensitivity for finding DLAs with much lower metallicities. However, this floor is not statistically different from a steep tail to the distribution. We also find that the intrinsic scatter of metallicity among DLAs of ~0.5 dex continues out to z ~ 5. In addition, the metallicity distribution and the alpha/Fe ratios of z > 2 DLAs are consistent with being drawn from the same parent population with those of halo stars. It is therefore possible that the halo stars in the Milky Way formed out of gas that commonly exhibits DLA absorption at z > 2.},

	Abstract = {Simulations of the formation of galaxies, as well as ionization models used to interpret observations of quasar absorption lines, generally either assume ionization equilibrium or ignore the presence of the extragalactic background (EGB) radiation. We introduce a method to compute the non-equilibrium ionization and cooling of diffuse gas exposed to the EGB. Our method iterates the ionization states of the 11 elements that dominate the cooling (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, Mg, S, Ca and Fe) and uses tabulated ion-by-ion cooling and photo-heating efficiencies to update the temperature of the gas. Our reaction network includes radiative and di-electric recombination, collisional ionization, photoionization, Auger ionization and charge transfer. We verify that our method reproduces published results for collisional equilibrium, collisional non-equilibrium and photoionized equilibrium. Non-equilibrium effects can become very important in cooling gas, particularly below 106 K. Photoionization and non-equilibrium effects both tend to boost the degree of ionization and to reduce cooling efficiencies. The effect of the EGB is larger for lower densities (i.e. higher ionization parameters). Hence, photoionization affects (equilibrium and non-equilibrium) cooling more under isochoric than under isobaric conditions. Non-equilibrium effects are smaller in the presence of the EGB and are thus overestimated when using collisional-only processes. The inclusion of the EGB alters the observational diagnostics of diffuse, metal-enriched gas (e.g. metal absorption lines probed in quasar sight lines) even more significantly than the cooling efficiencies. We argue that the cooling efficiency should be considered if ionization models are used to infer physical conditions from observed line ratios, as the a priori probability of observing gas is lower if its cooling time is shorter. We provide online tables of ionization fractions and cooling efficiencies, as well as other data, for equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios, and both with and without an EGB. Cooling efficiencies and diagnostics of the physical state of diffuse gas can become highly inaccurate if ionization equilibrium is assumed or if the existence of the ionizing background is ignored.},

We present results for gas temperatures between 104 and 108 K, assuming dust-free and optically thin conditions, and no external radiation. For nonequilibrium cooling we solve the coupled time-dependent ionization and energy loss equations for a radiating gas cooling from an initially hot, >~5×106 K, equilibrium state, down to 104 K. We present results for heavy element compositions ranging from 10-3 to 2 times the elemental abundances in the Sun. We consider gas cooling at constant density (isochoric) and at constant pressure (isobaric). We calculate the critical column densities and temperatures at which radiatively cooling clouds make the dynamical transition from isobaric to isochoric evolution. We construct ion ratio diagnostics for the temperature and metallicity in radiatively cooling gas. We provide numerical estimates for the maximal cloud column densities for which the gas remains optically thin to the cooling radiation. We present our computational results in convenient online figures and tables.},

	Abstract = {We study the physical conditions of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around z = 0.25 galaxies as traced by H I and metal line absorption, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include galactic outflows. Using lines of sight targeted at impact parameters from 10 kpc to 1 Mpc around galaxies with halo masses from 1011-1013 M&sun;, we study the physical conditions and their variation with impact parameter b and line-of-sight velocity Deltav in the CGM as traced by H I, Mg II, Si IV, C IV, O VI and Ne VIII absorbers. All ions show a strong excess of absorption near galaxies compared to random lines of sight. The excess continues beyond 1 Mpc, reflecting the correlation of metal absorption with large-scale structure. Absorption is particularly enhanced within about Deltav < 300 km s-1 and roughly 300 kpc of galaxies (with distances somewhat larger for the highest ion), approximately delineating the CGM; this range contains the majority of global metal absorption. Low ions like Mg II and Si IV predominantly arise in denser gas closer to galaxies and drop more rapidly with b, while high ions O VI and Ne VIII trace more diffusely distributed gas with a comparatively flat radial profile; C IV is intermediate. All ions predominantly trace T ˜ 104-4.5 K photoionized gas at all b, but when hot CGM gas is present (mostly in larger haloes), we see strong collisionally ionized O VI and Ne VIII at b <= 100 kpc. Larger halo masses generally produce more absorption, though overall the trends are not as strong as that with impact parameter. These findings arise using our favoured outflow scalings as expected for momentum-driven winds; with no winds, the CGM gas remains mostly unenriched, while our outflow model with a constant velocity and mass loading factor produce hotter, more widely dispersed metals.},

@article{ford2014,
	Abstract = {We examine how H I and metal absorption lines within low-redshift galaxy haloes trace the dynamical state of circumgalactic gas, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a well-vetted heuristic model for galactic outflows. We categorize inflowing, outflowing, and ambient gas based on its history and fate as tracked in our simulation. Following our earlier work, showing that the ionization level of absorbers was a primary factor in determining the physical conditions of absorbing gas, we show here that it is also a governing factor for its dynamical state. Low-ionization metal absorbers (e.g. Mg II) tend to arise in gas that will fall on to galaxies within several Gyr, while high-ionization metal absorbers (e.g. O VI) generally trace material that was deposited by outflows many Gyr ago. Inflowing gas is dominated by enriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow; hence, accretion at low redshifts is typically substantially enriched. Recycling wind material is preferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower mass haloes since high-mass haloes have more hot gas that is able to support itself against infall. Low-mass haloes also tend to re-eject more of their accreted material, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher mass loading factors for lower mass galaxies. Typical H I absorbers trace unenriched ambient material that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger H I absorbers arise in cool, enriched inflowing gas. Instantaneous radial velocity measures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing between inflowing and outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows. These results suggest that probing halo gas using a range of absorbers can provide detailed information about the amount and physical conditions of material that is participating in the baryon cycle.},

	Abstract = {The equivalent widths of {{Mg}} {{II}} absorption in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) trace the global star formation rate up to z < 6, are larger for star-forming galaxies than passively evolving galaxies, and decrease with increasing distance from the galaxy. We delve further into the physics involved by investigating gas kinematics and cloud column density distributions as a function of galaxy color, redshift, and projected distance from the galaxy (normalized by galaxy virial radius, D/Rvir). For 39 isolated galaxies at 0.3 < zgal < 1.0, we have detected {{Mg}} {{II}} absorption in high-resolution (Deltav ~= 6.6 km s-1) spectra of background quasars within a projected distance of 7 < D < 190 kpc. We characterize the absorption velocity spread using pixel-velocity two-point correlation functions. Velocity dispersions and cloud column densities for blue galaxies do not differ with redshift nor with D/Rvir. This suggests that outflows continually replenish the CGM of blue galaxies with high velocity dispersion, large column density gas out to large distances. Conversely, absorption hosted by red galaxies evolves with redshift where the velocity dispersions (column densities) are smaller (larger) at zgal < 0.656. After taking into account larger possible velocities in more massive galaxies, we find that there is no difference in the velocity dispersions or column densities for absorption hosted by red galaxies with D/Rvir. Thus, a lack of outflows in red galaxies causes the CGM to become more quiescent over time, with lower velocity dispersions and larger column densities toward lower zgal. The quenching of star formation appears to affect the CGM out to D/Rvir = 0.75.},

	Abstract = {We analyze Mg II lambdalambda2796, 2803 and Fe II lambdalambda2586, 2600 absorption profiles in individual spectra of 105 galaxies at 0.3 < z < 1.4. The galaxies, drawn from redshift surveys of the GOODS fields and the Extended Groth Strip, sample the range in star formation rates (SFRs) occupied by the star-forming sequence with stellar masses log M */M &sun; >~ 9.6 down to SFR gsim 2 M &sun; yr-1 at 0.3 < z < 0.7. Using the Doppler shifts of Mg II and Fe II absorption as tracers of cool gas kinematics, we detect large-scale winds in 66 $\pm$ 5% of the galaxies. Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging and our spectral analysis indicate that the outflow detection rate depends primarily on galaxy orientation: winds are detected in ~89% of galaxies having inclinations (i) <30$\,^{\circ}$ (face-on), while the wind detection rate is ~45% in objects having i > 50$\,^{\circ}$ (edge-on). Combined with the comparatively weak dependence of wind detection rate on intrinsic galaxy properties, this implies that biconical outflows are ubiquitous in normal, star-forming galaxies at z ~ 0.5. We find that wind velocity is correlated with galaxy M * at 3.4sigma significance, while outflow equivalent width is correlated with SFR at 3.5sigma significance, suggesting hosts with higher SFR launch more material and/or generate a larger velocity spread for the absorbing clouds. Assuming the gas is driven into halos with isothermal density profiles, the wind velocities (~200-400 km s-1) permit escape from the halo potentials only for the lowest-M * systems in the sample. However, the gas carries sufficient energy to reach distances >~ 50 kpc, and may therefore be a viable source of material for the massive, cool circumgalactic medium around bright galaxies at z ~ 0.},

	Abstract = {We study the ionization structure of galactic outflows in 37 nearby, star-forming galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We use the O I, Si II, Si III, and Si IV ultraviolet absorption lines to characterize the different ionization states of outflowing gas. We measure the equivalent widths, line widths, and outflow velocities of the four transitions, and find shallow scaling relations between them and galactic stellar mass and star formation rate. Regardless of the ionization potential, lines of similar strength have similar velocities and line widths, indicating that the four transitions can be modelled as a comoving phase. The Si equivalent width ratios (e.g. Si IV/Si II) have low dispersion, and little variation with stellar mass; while ratios with O I and Si vary by a factor of 2 for a given stellar mass. Photoionization models reproduce these equivalent width ratios, while shock models under predict the relative amount of high ionization gas. The photoionization models constrain the ionization parameter (U) between -2.25 < log (U) < -1.5, and require that the outflow metallicities are greater than 0.5 Z&sun;. We derive ionization fractions for the transitions, and show that the range of ionization parameters and stellar metallicities leads to a factor of 1.15-10 variation in the ionization fractions. Historically, mass outflow rates are calculated by converting a column density measurement from a single metal ion into a total hydrogen column density using an ionization fraction, thus mass outflow rates are sensitive to the assumed ionization structure of the outflow.},

	Abstract = {We place general constraints on the luminosity and mass of hot X-ray-emitting gas residing in extended "hot halos" around nearby massive galaxies. We examine stacked images of 2165 galaxies from the 2MASS Isolated Galaxy Catalog as well as subsets of this sample based on galaxy morphology and K-band luminosity. We detect X-ray emission at high confidence (ranging up to nearly 10sigma) for each subsample of galaxies. The average LX within 50 kpc is 1.0 $\pm$ 0.1 (statistical) $\pm$0.2 (systematic) × 1040 erg s-1, although the early-type galaxies are more than twice as luminous as the late-type galaxies. Using a spatial analysis, we also find evidence for extended emission around five out of seven subsamples (the full sample, the luminous galaxies, early-type galaxies, luminous late-type galaxies, and luminous early-type galaxies) at 92.7%, 99.3%, 89.3%, 98.7%, and 92.1% confidence, respectively. Several additional lines of evidence also support this conclusion and suggest that about 1/2 of the total emission is extended, and about 1/3 of the extended emission comes from hot gas. For the sample of luminous galaxies, which has the strongest evidence for extended emission, the average hot gas mass is 4 × 109 M &sun; within 50 kpc and the implied accretion rate is 0.4 M &sun; yr-1.},

	Abstract = {We analyze intergalactic H I and O VI absorbers with v < 5000 km s-1 in Hubble Space Telescope and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer spectra of 76 active galactic nuclei. The baryons traced by H I/O VI absorption are clearly associated with the extended surroundings of galaxies; for impact parameters <400 kpc they are 2-4 times more numerous as those inside the galaxies. This large reservoir of matter likely plays a major role in galaxy evolution. We tabulate the fraction of absorbers having a galaxy of a given luminosity within a given impact parameter (rho) and velocity difference (Deltav), as well as the fraction of galaxies with an absorber closer than a given rho and Deltav. We identify possible "void absorbers" (rho > 3 Mpc to the nearest L * galaxy), although at v < 2500 km s-1 all absorbers are within 1.5 Mpc of an L>0.1 L * galaxy. The absorber properties depend on rho, but the relations are not simple correlations. For four absorbers with rho = 50-350 kpc from an edge-on galaxy with known orientation of its rotation, we find no clear relation between absorber velocities and the rotation curve of the underlying galaxy. For rho < 350 kpc, the covering factor of Lyalpha (O VI) around L>0.1 L * galaxies is 100% (70%) for field galaxies and 65% (10%) for group galaxies; 50% of galaxy groups have associated Lyalpha. All O VI absorbers occur within 550 kpc of an L>0.25 L * galaxy. The properties of three of 14 O VI absorbers are consistent with photoionization, for five the evidence points to collisional ionization; the others are ambiguous. The fraction of broad Lyalpha lines increases from z = 3 to z = 0 and with decreasing impact parameter, consistent with the idea that gas inside ~500 kpc from galaxies is heating up, although alternative explanations cannot be clearly excluded.},

	Abstract = {This book deals with the nature of interstellar matter, treating both the rarefied hydrogen and helium gas pervading the universe and the heavier atoms present in both the gas and dust grains. Observational results on all phases of the interstellar medium are summarized, various local phenomena occurring in the gas and in dust grains are discussed, and elastic collisions are studied in detail. Those interactions of the gas with radiation that can be understood without any detailed analysis of excitation conditions are examined and then treated on the basis of the steady-state equation, which is also used to analyze ionization, dissociation, and gas heating. The optical properties of grains and corresponding results for grain radii, composition, and mean density are presented; results of optical polarization studies and an alignment analysis are also reported. The theory of such grain properties as electric charge, temperature, radiative acceleration, and likely evolution is considered. The overall equilibrium and dynamics of the interstellar gas are investigated, including explosions of H II regions and supernova shells as well as processes of star formation.},

	Abstract = {We determine the velocity vector of M31 with respect to the Milky Way and use this to constrain the mass of the Local Group, based on Hubble Space Telescope proper-motion measurements of three fields presented in Paper I. We construct N-body models for M31 to correct the measurements for the contributions from stellar motions internal to M31. This yields an unbiased estimate for the M31 center-of-mass motion. We also estimate the center-of-mass motion independently, using the kinematics of satellite galaxies of M31 and the Local Group, following previous work but with an expanded satellite sample. All estimates are mutually consistent, and imply a weighted average M31 heliocentric transverse velocity of (vW , vN ) = (- 125.2 $\pm$ 30.8, -73.8 $\pm$ 28.4) km s-1. We correct for the reflex motion of the Sun using the most recent insights into the solar motion within the Milky Way, which imply a larger azimuthal velocity than previously believed. This implies a radial velocity of M31 with respect to the Milky Way of V rad, M31 = -109.3 $\pm$ 4.4 km s-1, and a tangential velocity of V tan, M31 = 17.0 km s-1, with a 1sigma confidence region of V tan, M31 <= 34.3 km s-1. Hence, the velocity vector of M31 is statistically consistent with a radial (head-on collision) orbit toward the Milky Way. We revise prior estimates for the Local Group timing mass, including corrections for cosmic bias and scatter, and obtain M LG ≡ M MW, vir + M M31, vir = (4.93 $\pm$ 1.63) × 1012 M &sun;. Summing known estimates for the individual masses of M31 and the Milky Way obtained from other dynamical methods yields smaller uncertainties. Bayesian combination of the different estimates demonstrates that the timing argument has too much (cosmic) scatter to help much in reducing uncertainties on the Local Group mass, but its inclusion does tend to increase other estimates by ~10%. We derive a final estimate for the Local Group mass from literature and new considerations of M LG = (3.17 $\pm$ 0.57) × 1012 M &sun;. The velocity and mass results at 95% confidence imply that M33 is bound to M31, consistent with expectation from observed tidal deformations.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of 68 classical Cepheids, most detected from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope POMME Survey, with periods from 10 to 78 days observed in the near-infrared by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury Program using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The combination of HST's resolution and the use of near-infrared measurements provide a dramatic reduction in the dispersion of the period-luminosity relation over the present optical, ground-based data. Even using random phase magnitudes we measure a dispersion of just 0.17 mag, implying a dispersion of just 0.12 mag for mean magnitudes. The error in the mean for this relation is 1% in distance. Combined with similar observations of Cepheids in other hosts and independent distance determinations, we measure a distance to M31 of mu0 = 24.38 $\pm$ 0.06(statistical) $\pm$ 0.03(systematic), 752 $\pm$ 27 kpc, in good agreement with past measurements though with a better, 3% precision here. The result is also in good agreement with independent distance determinations from two detached eclipsing binaries allowing for an independent calibration of the Cepheid luminosities and a determination of the Hubble constant.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Green Bank Telescope 21 cm observations have revealed a faint, yet extensive H I cloud population surrounding the Andromeda galaxy (M31). The newfound objects are likely analogs to the high-velocity H I clouds seen around the Milky Way. At least 20 discrete features are detected within 50 kpc of the M31 disk, with radial velocities that are comparable to those of outer disk rotation. In addition, a filamentary ``halo'' component of at least 30 kpc extent is concentrated at the M31 systemic velocity. Some of the discrete features are organized into elongated systems with velocity continuity, suggestive of tidal streams. The discrete population can be characterized by a steep power-law distribution of number versus H I mass in the range between 105 and 107 Msolar. The velocity line width of discrete clouds is correlated with the cloud H I mass such that if the clouds are gravitationally bound this implies a dark matter to H I mass ratio of ~100:1. Possible origins for the discrete and halo M31 features include a LoGroup ``cooling flow,'' tidal debris from recent mergers or interactions, and the gaseous counterparts of low-mass dark matter halos.},

	Abstract = {We have used the Westerbork array to carry out an unbiased wide-field survey of HI emission features, achieving an rms sensitivity of about 18 mJy/Beam at a velocity resolution of 17 km s-1 over 1800 deg2 and between -1000<VHel<+6500 km s-1. The primary data consists of auto-correlation spectra with an effective angular resolution of 49' FWHM. The survey region is centered approximately on the position of Messier 31 and is Nyquist-sampled over 60×30o in RA×Dec. In this paper we present our HI detections at negative velocities which could be distinguished from the Galactic foreground. Fully 29% of the entire survey area has high velocity HI emission at a column density exceeding our 3sigma limit of about 1.5×1017 cm-2 over 30 km s-1.  We tabulate the properties of 95 discrete HVC components in the field, corresponding to more than an order of magnitude increase in number over that known previously. The distribution of discrete object number with flux density has an inflection point near 12 Jy-km s-1 which may correspond to a characteristic mass and distance for this population. A faint population of discrete HVCs is detected in the immediate vicinity of M 31 which spans a large fraction of the M 31 rotation velocity. This class of features is confined to about 12o (160 kpc) projected radius of M 31 and appears to be physically associated. Independent confirmation of the features within 3.5 $\,^{\circ}$ (47 kpc) of M 31 has been obtained in our Green Bank Telescope survey (Thilker et al. \cite{thil03}). We detect a diffuse northern extension of the Magellanic Stream (MS) from at least delta=+20 -> 40o, which subsequently loops back toward the south. Recent numerical simulations had predicted just such an MS extension corresponding to the apo-galacticon portion of the LMC/SMC orbit at a distance of 125 kpc. A faint bridge of HI emission appears to join the systemic velocities of M 31 with that of M 33 and continues beyond M 31 to the north-west. This may be the first detection of HI associated with the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). The distribution of peculiar velocity HI associated with M 31 can be described by a projected exponential of 25 kpc scale-length and 5×1017 cm-2 peak column density. We present the distribution function of NHI in the extended M 31 environment, which agrees well with the low red-shift QSO absorption line data over the range log(NHI)=17.2 to log(NHI)=21.9. Our data extend this comparison about two orders of magnitude lower than previously possible and provide the first image of the Lyman limit absorption system associated with an L* Galaxy.

@article{westmeier2005,
	Abstract = {We have undertaken high-resolution follow-up of a sample of high velocity H I clouds apparently associated with M 31. Our sample was chosen from the population of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) detected out to 50 kpc projected radius of the Andromeda Galaxy by Thilker et al. (2004, ApJ, 601, L39) with the Green Bank Telescope. Nine pointings were observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope to determine the physical parameters of these objects and to find clues to their origin. One additional pointing was directed at a similar object near M 33. At 2' resolution we detect 16 individual HVCs around M 31 and 1 HVC near M 33 with typical H I masses of a few times 105 M&sun; and sizes of the order of 1 kpc. Estimates of the dynamical and virial masses of some of the HVCs indicate that they are likely gravitationally dominated by additional mass components such as dark matter or ionised gas. Twelve of the clouds are concentrated in an area of only 1$\,^{\circ}$ × 1$\,^{\circ}$ at a projected separation of less than 15 kpc from the disk of M 31. This HVC complex has a rather complicated morphological and kinematical structure and partly overlaps with the giant stellar stream of M 31, suggesting a tidal origin. Another detected feature is in close proximity, in both position and velocity, with NGC 205, perhaps also indicative of tidal processes. Other HVCs in our survey are isolated and might represent primordial, dark-matter dominated clouds.},

@article{van-de-voort2012a,
	Abstract = {We study the properties of gas inside and around galaxy haloes as a function of radius and halo mass, focusing mostly on z= 2, but also showing some results for z= 0. For this purpose, we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. The properties of cold- and hot-mode gas, which we separate depending on whether the temperature has been higher than 105.5 K while it was extragalactic, are clearly distinguishable in the outer parts of massive haloes (virial temperatures ≫105 K). The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble those between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly confined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium with the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas typically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling. However, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given mode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong statements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong cooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas accreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback results in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii. The gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also account for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass. We argue that cold streams penetrating hot haloes are observable as high column density H I Lyman alpha absorption systems in sightlines near massive foreground galaxies.},

	Abstract = {A large fraction of the gas in galactic haloes has temperatures between 104.5 and 107 K. At these temperatures, cooling is dominated by metal-line emission if the metallicity Z ≳ 0.1 Z&sun;, and several lines may be detectable with current and upcoming instruments. We explore this possibility using several large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. We stack surface brightness maps centred on galaxies to calculate the expected mean surface brightness profiles for different halo masses. We only consider emission from intergalactic gas with densities nH < 0.1 cm-3. Results are shown for soft X-ray lines at z = 0.125, ultraviolet (UV) lines and hydrogen Balmer-alpha (Halpha) at z = 0.25, and rest-frame UV lines at z = 3. Assuming a detection limit of 10-1 photon s-1 cm-2 sr-1, proposed X-ray telescopes can detect O VIII emission from z = 0.125 out to 80 per cent of the virial radius (Rvir) of groups and clusters and out to 0.4Rvir for haloes with masses 1012-13 M&sun;. Emission lines from C VI, N VII, O VII and Ne X can be detected out to smaller radii, 0.1-0.5Rvir. With a detection limit of 10-20 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2, future UV telescopes can detect C III emission out to 0.2-0.6Rvir at z = 0.25, depending on halo mass. C IV, O VI, Si III and Si IV can be seen out to 10-20 per cent of the virial radius in haloes more massive than 1012 M&sun;. Optical Halpha emission is comparable in strength to C III emission and could be observed out to 0.3-0.6Rvir at z = 0.25 with upcoming optical instruments. At z = 3, it may be possible to observe C III out to 0.2-0.3Rvir and other rest-frame UV lines out to ˜0.1Rvir in haloes larger than 1011 M&sun; with the same optical instruments. Metal-line emission is typically biased towards high density and metallicity and towards the temperature at which the emissivity curve of the corresponding metal-line peaks. This bias varies with radius, halo mass and redshift. The bias is similar for the different soft X-ray lines considered, whereas it varies strongly between different UV lines. Active galactic nucleus feedback can change the inner surface brightness profiles significantly, but it generally does not change the radius out to which the emission can be observed. Metal-line emission is a promising probe of the warm and hot, enriched gas around galaxies and provides a unique window into the interactions between galaxies and their gaseous haloes.},

@article{van-de-voort2012,
	Abstract = {Simulations predict that galaxies grow primarily through the accretion of gas that has not gone through an accretion shock near the virial radius and that this cold gas flows towards the central galaxy along dense filaments and streams. There is, however, little observational evidence for the existence of these cold flows. We use a large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation that has been post-processed with radiative transfer to study the contribution of cold flows to the observed z= 3 column density distribution of neutral hydrogen, which our simulation reproduces. We find that nearly all of the H I absorption arises in gas that has remained colder than 105.5 K, at least while it was extragalactic. In addition, the majority of the H I is falling rapidly towards a nearby galaxy, with non-negligible contributions from outflowing and static gas. Above a column density of ? cm-2, most of the absorbers reside inside haloes, but the interstellar medium only dominates for ? cm-2. Haloes with total mass below 1010 M&sun; dominate the absorption for ? cm-2, but the average halo mass increases sharply for higher column densities. Although very little of the H I in absorbers with ? cm-2 resides inside galaxies, systems with ? cm-2 are closely related to star formation: most of their H I either will become part of the interstellar medium before z= 2 or has been ejected from a galaxy at z > 3. Cold accretion flows are critical for the success of our simulation in reproducing the observed rate of incidence of damped Lyman-alpha and particularly that of Lyman limit systems. We therefore conclude that cold accretion flows exist and have already been detected in the form of high column density H I absorbers.},

	Abstract = {The cosmic star formation rate is observed to drop sharply after redshift z= 2. We use two large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion and to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop in the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global cold-mode accretion rate density on to haloes, but with a delay of the order of the gas consumption time-scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode (hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature never exceeded (did exceed) 105.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks at z≈ 3, the hot mode continues to increase to z≈ 1 and remains roughly constant thereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global accretion rate on to haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo accretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes on to galaxies. AGN feedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing the gas that entered haloes in the hot mode from accreting on to their central galaxies. Consequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode would become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop-off in the cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep.},

@article{van-de-voort2011,
	Abstract = {We study the rate at which gas accretes on to galaxies and haloes and investigate whether the accreted gas was shocked to high temperatures before reaching a galaxy. For this purpose, we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project, which uses a modified version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-3. We improve on previous work by considering a wider range of halo masses and redshifts, by distinguishing between accretion on to haloes and accretion on to galaxies, by including important feedback processes and by comparing simulations with different physics.  Gas accretion is mostly smooth, with mergers only becoming important for groups and clusters. The specific rate of the gas accretion on to haloes is, like that for dark matter, only weakly dependent on the halo mass. For halo masses Mhalo≫ 1011 M&sun;, it is relatively insensitive to feedback processes. In contrast, accretion rates on to galaxies are determined by radiative cooling and by outflows driven by supernovae and active galactic nuclei. Galactic winds increase the halo mass at which the central galaxies grow the fastest by about two orders of magnitude to Mhalo˜ 1012 M&sun;.  Gas accretion is bimodal, with maximum past temperatures either of the order of the virial temperature or ≲105 K. The fraction of the gas accreted on to haloes in the hot mode is insensitive to feedback and metal-line cooling. It increases with decreasing redshift, but is mostly determined by the halo mass, increasing gradually from less than 10 per cent for ˜1011 M&sun; to greater than 90 per cent at ˜1013 M&sun;. In contrast, for accretion on to galaxies, the cold mode is always significant and the relative contributions of the two accretion modes are more sensitive to feedback and metal-line cooling. On average, the majority of stars present in any mass halo at any redshift were formed from the gas accreted in the cold mode, although the hot mode contributes typically over 10 per cent for Mhalo≳ 1011 M&sun;.  Thus, while gas accretion on to haloes can be robustly predicted, the rate of accretion on to galaxies is sensitive to uncertain feedback processes. Nevertheless, it is clear that galaxies, but not necessarily their gaseous haloes, are predominantly fed by the gas that did not experience an accretion shock when it entered the host halo.},

	Abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive fast winds in the interstellar medium of their host galaxies. It is commonly assumed that the high ambient densities and intense radiation fields in galactic nuclei imply short cooling times, thus making the outflows momentum conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity shocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances, including conditions relevant to ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), resulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast energy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler gas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity vin ≳ 10 000 km s-1, as observed in ultraviolet and X-ray absorption, the shocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal pressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate directly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton cooling, while free-free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with vin ˜ 1000 km s-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience energy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the energy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor ˜vin/2vs by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where vs is the velocity of the swept-up material. Energy-conserving outflows driven by fast AGN winds (vin ˜ 0.1c) may therefore explain the momentum fluxes P≫LAGN/c of galaxy-scale outflows recently measured in luminous quasars and ULIRGs. Shocked wind bubbles expanding normal to galactic discs may also explain the large-scale bipolar structures observed in some systems, including around the Galactic Centre, and can produce significant radio, X-ray and gamma-ray emission. The analytic solutions presented here will inform implementations of AGN feedback in numerical simulations, which typically do not include all the important physics.},

	Abstract = {We present a two-zone theory for feedback-regulated star formation in galactic discs, consistently connecting the galaxy-averaged star formation law with star formation proceeding in giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Our focus is on galaxies with gas surface density Sigmag ≳ 100 M&sun; pc-2, where the interstellar medium (ISM) can be assumed to be fully molecular. This regime includes most star formation in the Universe and our basic framework can be extended to other galaxies. In our theory, the galactic disc consists of Toomre-mass GMCs embedded in a volume-filling ISM. Radiation pressure on dust disperses GMCs and most supernovae explode in the volume-filling medium. A galaxy-averaged star formation law is derived by balancing the momentum input from supernova feedback with the vertical gravitational weight of the disc gas. This star formation law is in good agreement with observations for a CO conversion factor depending continuously on Sigmag. We argue that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free-fall time, ε _ff^gal, is only a weak function of the efficiency with which GMCs convert their gas into stars, ε _int^GMC. This is possible because the rate limiting step for star formation is the rate at which GMCs form: for large efficiency of star formation in GMCs, the Toomre Q parameter obtains a value slightly above unity so that the GMC formation rate is consistent with the galaxy-averaged star formation law. We contrast our results with other theories of turbulence-regulated star formation and discuss predictions of our model. Using a compilation of data from the literature, we show that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free-fall time is non-universal and increases with increasing gas fraction, as predicted by our model. We also predict that the fraction of the disc gas mass in bound GMCs decreases for increasing values of the GMC star formation efficiency. This is qualitatively consistent with the smooth molecular gas distribution inferred in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies and the small mass fraction in giant clumps in high-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments) project to make predictions for the covering fractions of neutral hydrogen around galaxies at z = 2-4. These simulations resolve the interstellar medium of galaxies and explicitly implement a comprehensive set of stellar feedback mechanisms. Our simulation sample consists of 16 main haloes covering the mass range Mh ≈ 109-6 × 1012 M&sun; at z = 2, including 12 haloes in the mass range Mh ˜ 1011-1012 M&sun; corresponding to Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). We process our simulations with a ray tracing method to compute the ionization state of the gas. Galactic winds increase the H I covering fractions in galaxy haloes by direct ejection of cool gas from galaxies and through interactions with gas inflowing from the intergalactic medium. Our simulations predict H I covering fractions for Lyman limit systems (LLSs) consistent with measurements around z ˜ 2-2.5 LBGs; these covering fractions are a factor ˜2 higher than our previous calculations without galactic winds. The fractions of H I absorbers arising in inflows and in outflows are on average ˜50 per cent but exhibit significant time variability, ranging from ˜10 to ˜90 per cent. For our most massive haloes, we find a factor ˜3 deficit in the LLS covering fraction relative to what is measured around quasars at z ˜ 2, suggesting that the presence of a quasar may affect the properties of halo gas on ˜100 kpc scales. The predicted covering fractions, which decrease with time, peak at Mh ˜ 1011-1012 M&sun;, near the peak of the star formation efficiency in dark matter haloes. In our simulations, star formation and galactic outflows are highly time dependent; H I covering fractions are also time variable but less so because they represent averages over large areas.},

	Abstract = {We present a complete catalog of 27 O VI absorbers at low redshift (0.12<z<0.5) from a blind survey of 16 QSO echelle spectra in the Hubble Space Telescoep Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph data archive. These absorbers are identified based only on matching line profiles and the expected doublet ratio between the lambdalambda1031, 1037 transitions. Subsequent searches are carried out to identify their associated transitions. Here we present all relevant absorption properties. By considering absorption components of different species that are well aligned in velocity space, we derive gas temperatures and nonthermal broadening values, bnt. We show that in all 16 cases considered the observed line width is dominated by nonthermal motion and that gas temperatures are well below those expected for O5+ in collisional ionization equilibrium. This result reaffirms previous findings from studies of individual lines of sight but are at odds with expectations for a WHIM origin. At least half of the absorbers can be explained by a simple photoionization model. In addition, in some absorbers we find evidence for large variation in gas density/metallicity across components in individual absorbers. Comparisons of multiple associated metal species further show that under the assumption of the gas being photoionized by the metagalactic background radiation field, the absorbing clouds have gas densities H><-2.9 and sizes L>1 kpc. Finally, we compare our absorber selection with the results of other independent studies.

	Abstract = {We report new observations of circumgalactic gas in the halos of early-type galaxies (ETGs) obtained by the COS-Halos Survey with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that detections of H I surrounding ETGs are typically as common and strong as around star-forming galaxies, implying that the total mass of circumgalactic material is comparable in the two populations. For ETGs, the covering fraction for H I absorption above 1016 cm-2 is ~40%-50% within ~150 kpc. Line widths and kinematics of the detected material show it to be cold (T <~ 105 K) in comparison to the virial temperature of the host halos. The implied masses of cool, photoionized circumgalactic medium baryons may be up to 109-1011 M &sun;. Contrary to some theoretical expectations, strong halo H I absorbers do not disappear as part of the quenching of star formation. Even passive galaxies retain significant reservoirs of halo baryons that could replenish the interstellar gas reservoir and eventually form stars. This halo gas may feed the diffuse and molecular gas that is frequently observed inside ETGs.

	Abstract = {We examine the H I content and environment of all of the Local Group dwarf galaxies (M tot < 1010 M sun), including the numerous newly discovered satellites of the Milky Way and M31. All of the new dwarfs, with the exception of Leo T, have no detected H I. The majority of dwarf galaxies within ~270 kpc of the Milky Way or Andromeda are undetected in H I (<104 M sun for Milky Way dwarfs), while those further than ~270 kpc are predominantly detected with masses ~105 to 108 M sun. Analytical ram-pressure arguments combined with velocities obtained via proper motion studies allow for an estimate of the halo density of the Milky Way at several distances. This halo density is constrained to be greater than 2× 10-4-3 × 10-4 cm-3 out to distances of at least 70 kpc. This is broadly consistent with theoretical models of the diffuse gas in a Milky Way-like halo and is consistent with this component hosting a large fraction of a galaxy's baryons. Accounting for completeness in the dwarf galaxy count, gasless dwarf galaxies could have provided at most 2.1 × 108 M sun of H I gas to the Milky Way, which suggests that most of our Galaxy's star formation fuel does not come from accreted small satellites in the current era.},

	Abstract = {We present the design and methods of the COS-Halos survey, a systematic investigation of the gaseous halos of 44 z = 0.15-0.35 galaxies using background QSOs observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. This survey has yielded 39 spectra of z em ~= 0.5 QSOs with S/N ~10-15 per resolution element. The QSO sightlines pass within 150 physical kpc of the galaxies, which span early and late types over stellar mass log M */M &sun; = 9.5-11.5. We find that the circumgalactic medium exhibits strong H I, averaging ~= 1 {\AA} in Lyalpha equivalent width out to 150 kpc, with 100% covering fraction for star-forming galaxies and 75% covering for passive galaxies. We find good agreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies over similar range of impact parameter. There is weak evidence for a difference between early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of H I. Kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy, such that >~ 90% of the detected column density is confined within $\pm$200 km s-1 of the galaxies. This material generally exists well below the halo virial temperatures at T <~ 105 K. We evaluate a number of possible origin scenarios for the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which the bulk of the detected H I arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionized diffuse medium that is generic to all L* galaxies and may harbor a total gaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.

	Abstract = {The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is fed by galaxy outflows and accretion of intergalactic gas, but its mass, heavy element enrichment, and relation to galaxy properties are poorly constrained by observations. In a survey of the outskirts of 42 galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we detected ubiquitous, large (150-kiloparsec) halos of ionized oxygen surrounding star-forming galaxies; we found much less ionized oxygen around galaxies with little or no star formation. This ionized CGM contains a substantial mass of heavy elements and gas, perhaps far exceeding the reservoirs of gas in the galaxies themselves. Our data indicate that it is a basic component of nearly all star-forming galaxies that is removed or transformed during the quenching of star formation and the transition to passive evolution.},

	Abstract = {We combine H I 21 cm observations of the Milky Way, M31, and the local galaxy population with QSO absorption-line measurements to geometrically model the three-dimensional distribution of infalling neutral-gas clouds ("high-velocity clouds" (HVCs)) in the extended halos of low-redshift galaxies. We demonstrate that the observed distribution of HVCs around the Milky Way and M31 can be modeled by a radial exponential decline of the mean H I volume-filling factor in their halos. Our model suggests a characteristic radial extent of HVCs of R halo ~ 50 kpc, a total H I mass in HVCs of ~108 M &sun;, and a neutral-gas accretion rate of ~0.7 M &sun; yr-1 for M31/Milky-Way-type galaxies. Using a Holmberg-like luminosity scaling of the halo size of galaxies we estimate R halo ~ 110 kpc for the most massive galaxies. The total absorption cross-section of HVCs at z ≈ 0 most likely is dominated by galaxies with total H I masses between 108.5 and 1010 M &sun;. Our model indicates that the H I disks of galaxies and their surrounding HVC population can account for 30%-100% of intervening QSO absorption-line systems with log N(H I) >= 17.5 at z ≈ 0. We estimate that the neutral-gas accretion rate density of galaxies at low redshift from infalling HVCs is dM_H\,\mathsc{i}/dt/dV \approx 0.022\,M_{\odot } yr-1 Mpc-3, which is close to the measured star formation rate density in the local universe. HVCs thus may play an important role in the ongoing formation and evolution of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the physical conditions of the cool, photoionized (T ~104 K) circumgalactic medium (CGM) using the COS-Halos suite of gas column density measurements for 44 gaseous halos within 160 kpc of L ~ L* galaxies at z ~ 0.2. These data are well described by simple photoionization models, with the gas highly ionized (n H II /n H >~ 99%) by the extragalactic ultraviolet background. Scaling by estimates for the virial radius, R vir, we show that the ionization state (tracked by the dimensionless ionization parameter, U) increases with distance from the host galaxy. The ionization parameters imply a decreasing volume density profile n H = (10-4.2 $\pm$ 0.25)(R/R vir)-0.8 $\pm$ 0.3. Our derived gas volume densities are several orders of magnitude lower than predictions from standard two-phase models with a cool medium in pressure equilibrium with a hot, coronal medium expected in virialized halos at this mass scale. Applying the ionization corrections to the H I column densities, we estimate a lower limit to the cool gas mass M_CGM^cool \gt 6.5 × 1010 M &sun; for the volume within R < R vir. Allowing for an additional warm-hot, O VI-traced phase, the CGM accounts for at least half of the baryons purported to be missing from dark matter halos at the 1012 M &sun; scale.},

	Abstract = {We present a budget and accounting of metals in and around star-forming galaxies at z ~ 0. We combine empirically derived star formation histories with updated supernova and asymptotic giant branch yields and rates to estimate the total mass of metals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of 109.3-1011.6 M&sun;. On the accounting side of the ledger, we show that a surprisingly constant 20%-25% mass fraction of produced metals remain in galaxies' stars, interstellar gas and interstellar dust, with little dependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass (omitting those metals immediately locked up in remnants). Thus, the bulk of metals are outside of galaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's L* galaxies. The COS-Halos survey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalactic medium (CGM, to impact parameters of <150 kpc) of low-redshift ~L* galaxies. Using these data, we map the distribution of CGM metals as traced by both the highly ionized O VI ion and a suite of low-ionization species; combined with constraints on circumgalactic dust and hotter X-ray emitting gas out to similar impact parameters, we show that ~40% of metals produced by M sstarf ~ 1010 M&sun; galaxies can be easily accounted for out to 150 kpc. With the current data, we cannot rule out a constant mass of metals within this fixed physical radius. This census provides a crucial boundary condition for the eventual fate of metals in galaxy evolution models.

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the galaxy-scale gaseous outflows from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. This suite of hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations resolves formation of star-forming giant molecular clouds to z = 0, and features an explicit stellar feedback model on small scales. Our simulations reveal that high-redshift galaxies undergo bursts of star formation followed by powerful gusts of galactic outflows that eject much of the interstellar medium and temporarily suppress star formation. At low redshift, however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L* progenitors develop stable discs and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of star formation that does not drive outflows far into the halo. Mass-loading factors for winds in L* progenitors are eta ≈ 10 at high redshift, but decrease to eta ≪ 1 at low redshift. Although lower values of eta are expected as haloes grow in mass over time, we show that the strong suppression of outflows with decreasing redshift cannot be explained by mass evolution alone. Circumgalactic outflow velocities are variable and broadly distributed, but typically range between one and three times the circular velocity of the halo. Much of the ejected material builds a reservoir of enriched gas within the circumgalactic medium, some of which could be later recycled to fuel further star formation. However, a fraction of the gas that leaves the virial radius through galactic winds is never regained, causing most haloes with mass Mh <= 1012 M&sun; to be deficient in baryons compared to the cosmic mean by z = 0.},

	Abstract = {We present new results on the kinematics, thermal and ionization state, and spatial distribution of metal-enriched gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of massive galaxies at redshift ~3, using the Eris suite of cosmological hydrodynamic "zoom-in" simulations. The reference run adopts a blastwave scheme for supernova feedback that produces large-scale galactic outflows, a star formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold, metal-dependent radiative cooling, and a model for the diffusion of metals and thermal energy. The effect of the local UV radiation field is added in post-processing. The CGM (defined as all gas at R > 0.2 R vir = 10 kpc, where R vir is the virial radius) contains multiple phases having a wide range of physical conditions, with more than half of its heavy elements locked in a warm-hot component at T > 105 K. Synthetic spectra, generated by drawing sightlines through the CGM, produce interstellar absorption-line strengths of Lyalpha, C II, C IV, Si II, and Si IV as a function of the galactocentric impact parameter (scaled to the virial radius) that are in broad agreement with those observed at high redshift by Steidel et al. The covering factor of absorbing material declines less rapidly with impact parameter for Lyalpha and C IV compared to C II, Si IV, and Si II, with Lyalpha remaining strong (W Lyalpha > 300 m{\AA}) to >~ 5 R vir = 250 kpc. Only about one third of all the gas within R vir is outflowing. The fraction of sightlines within one virial radius that intercept optically thick, N H I>1017.2 cm-2 material is 27%, in agreement with recent observations by Rudie et al. Such optically thick absorption is shown to trace inflowing "cold" streams that penetrate deep inside the virial radius. The streams, enriched to metallicities above 0.01 solar by previous episodes of star formation in the main host and in nearby dwarfs, are the origin of strong (N C II>1013 cm-2) C II absorption with a covering factor of 22% within R vir and 10% within 2 R vir. Galactic outflows do not cause any substantial suppression of the cold accretion mode. The central galaxy is surrounded by a large O VI halo, with a typical column density N O VI >~ 1014 cm-2 and a near unity covering factor maintained all the way out to 150 kpc. This matches the trends recently observed in star-forming galaxies at low redshift by Tumlinson et al. Our zoom-in simulations of this single system appear then to reproduce quantitatively the complex baryonic processes that determine the exchange of matter, energy, and metals between galaxies and their surroundings.},

	Abstract = {A detailed study of eight known Lyman limit absorption systems with 2.90 <= Zabs <= 3.23 has been undertaken in order to provide an unbiased preliminary survey of the properties of heavy element absorption systems at very high redshift. Selected spectral regions for each QSO have been observed at 35-80 km s-1 resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio so that the column densities of H I and associated ions of heavy elements might be determined. The H I column densities are in the range 17.0 <= log N(H I) <= 19.3. The column density measurements have been used in conjunction with photoionization models in order to estimate the physical parameters of the clouds or cloud ensembles responsible for the Lyman discontinuities. Although there are many uncertainties involved in the analysis, the heavy element abundances appear to be in the range -3.0 <= [M/H] <=-1.5, and the relative abundances of C, 0, and Si, although uncertain, appear to be consistent with a uniform depletion relative to the solar values. If the results of the photoionization models are accurate, the particle density in the clouds is in the range 0.01 ≲ nH ≲ 0.1 and the corresponding cloud sizes and masses are inferred to be in the range 1 <= Dc <= 15 kpc and 106 <= Mc <= 109 Msun, respectively. Such parameters would be expected on theoretical grounds for clouds that condensed in extended (≳ 100 kpc) gaseous halos during the early evolution of normal galaxies. A considerable fraction of the inferred visible mass of present-day galaxies was probably in the form of these diffuse clouds at the epoch corresponding to z ≈ 3; thus, they have probably played an important role in the evolution of galaxies with time. The possibility that the heavy element absorbing clouds and the "Lyman-alpha forest" clouds have a common origin (but evolve differently because of their environment) is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The Green Bank Telescope has been used to search for 21 cm H I emission over a large area between the galaxies M31 and M33 in an attempt to confirm at 9farcm1 angular resolution the detection by Braun & Thilker of a very extensive neutral gas "bridge" between the two systems at the level N H I  ≈ 1017 cm-2. We detect H I emission at several locations up to 120 kpc in projected distance from M31, at least half the distance to M33, with velocities similar to that of the galaxies, confirming the essence of the Braun & Thilker discovery. The H I does not appear to be associated with the extraplanar high-velocity clouds of either galaxy. In two places we measure N H I  > 3 × 1018 cm-2, indicative of concentrations of H I with ~105 M &sun; on scales <~ 2 kpc, but over most of the field we have only 5sigma upper limits of N H I  <= 1.4 × 1018 cm-2. In very deep measurements in two directions H I lines were detected at a few 1017 cm-2. The absence of emission at another location to a 5sigma limit N H I  <= 1.5 × 1017 cm-2 suggests that the H I bridge is either patchy or confined to within ~125 kpc of M31. The measurements also cover two of M31's dwarf galaxies, And II and And XV, but in neither case is there evidence for associated H I at the 5sigma level of 1.4 × 104 M &sun; for And II and 9.3 × 103 M &sun; for And XV.},

	Abstract = {A set of diffuse interstellar clouds in the inner Galaxy within a few hundred parsecs of the Galactic plane has been observed at an angular resolution of ≈1&farcm0 combining data from the NRAO Green Bank Telescope and the Very Large Array. At the distance of the clouds, the linear resolution ranges from ˜1.9 to ˜2.8 pc. These clouds have been selected to be somewhat outside of the Galactic plane, and thus are not confused with unrelated emission, but in other respects they are a Galactic population. They are located near the tangent points in the inner Galaxy, and thus at a quantifiable distance: 2.3<=slant R<=slant 6.0 kpc from the Galactic Center and -1000<=slant z<=slant +610 pc from the Galactic plane. These are the first images of the diffuse neutral H i clouds that may constitute a considerable fraction of the interstellar medium (ISM). Peak H i column densities lie in the range NH i  = 0.8-2.9 × 1020 cm-2. Cloud diameters vary between about 10 and 100 pc, and their H i mass spans the range from less than a hundred to a few thousands M&sun;. The clouds show no morphological consistency of any kind, except that their shapes are highly irregular. One cloud may lie within the hot wind from the nucleus of the Galaxy, and some clouds show evidence of two distinct thermal phases as would be expected from equilibrium models of the ISM.},

This feature has been interpreted to be the neutral component of a condensing intergalactic filament, which would be able to fuel star formation in M31 and M33, but simulations suggest that such a feature could also result from an interaction between both galaxies within the past few billion years (ref. 5). Here we report radio observations showing that about 50 per cent of this gas is composed of clouds, with the rest distributed in an extended, diffuse component. The clouds have velocities comparable to those of M31 and M33, and have properties suggesting that they are unrelated to other Local Group objects. We conclude that the clouds are likely to be transient condensations of gas embedded in an intergalactic filament and are therefore a potential source of fuel for future star formation in M31 and M33.},

	Abstract = {Very sensitive 21 cm H i measurements have been made at several locations around the Local Group galaxy M31 using the Green Bank Telescope at an angular resolution of 9.'1, with a 5sigma detection level of NH i = 3.9 × 1017 cm-2 for a 30 km s-1 line. Most of the H i in a 12 square-degree area almost equidistant between M31 and M33 is contained in nine discrete clouds that have a typical size of a few kpc and a H i mass of 105M&sun;. Their velocities in the Local Group Standard of Rest lie between -100 and +40 km s-1, comparable to the systemic velocities of M31 and M33. The clouds appear to be isolated kinematically and spatially from each other. The total H i mass of all nine clouds is 1.4 × 106M&sun; for an adopted distance of 800 kpc, with perhaps another 0.2 × 106M&sun; in smaller clouds or more diffuse emission. The H i mass of each cloud is typically three orders of magnitude less than the dynamical (virial) mass needed to bind the cloud gravitationally. Although they have the size and H i mass of dwarf galaxies, the clouds are unlikely to be part of the satellite system of the Local Group, as they lack stars. To the north of M31, sensitive H i measurements on a coarse grid find emission that may be associated with an extension of the M31 high-velocity cloud (HVC) population to projected distances of ˜100 kpc. An extension of the M31 HVC population at a similar distance to the southeast, toward M33, is not observed.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained Johnson V and Gunni photometry for a large number of Local Group galaxies using the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera (INT WFC). The majority of these galaxies are members of the M31 subgroup and the observations are deep enough to study the top few magnitudes of the red giant branch in each system. We previously measured the location of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) for Andromeda I, Andromeda II and M33 to within systematic uncertainties of typically <0.05 mag. As the TRGB acts as a standard candle in old, metal-poor stellar populations, we were able to derive distances to each of these galaxies. Here we derive TRGB distances to the giant spiral galaxy M31 and 13 additional dwarf galaxies - NGC 205, 185, 147, Pegasus, WLM, LGS3, Cetus, Aquarius, And III, V, VI, VII and the newly discovered dwarf spheroidal And IX. The observations for each of the dwarf galaxies were intentionally taken in photometric conditions. In addition to the distances, we also self-consistently derive the median metallicity of each system from the colour of their red giant branches. This allows us to take into account the small metallicity variation of the absolute I magnitude of the TRGB. The homogeneous nature of our data and the identical analysis applied to each of the 17 Local Group galaxies ensures that these estimates form a reliable set of distance and metallicity determinations that are ideal for comparative studies of Local Group galaxy properties.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We devise a data reduction and calibration system for producing highly-accurate 21-cm H i spectra from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) of the NRAO.  Methods: A theoretical analysis of the all-sky response of the GBT at 21 cm is made, augmented by extensive maps of the far sidelobes. Observations of radio sources and the Moon are made to check the resulting aperture and main beam efficiencies.  Results: The all-sky model made for the response of the GBT at 21 cm is used to correct for "stray" 21-cm radiation reaching the receiver through the sidelobes rather than the main beam. This reduces systematic errors in 21-cm measurements by about an order of magnitude, allowing accurate 21-cm H i spectra to be made at about 9' angular resolution with the GBT. At this resolution the procedures discussed here allow for measurement of total integrated Galactic H i line emission, W, with errors of 3 K km s-1, equivalent to errors in optically thin NHI of 5 × 1018 cm-2.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of one extremely metal-poor (EMP; [{Fe}/{{H}}]  \lt  -3) and one ultra metal-poor (UMP; [{Fe}/{{H}}]  \lt  -4) star selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey/Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration survey. These stars were identified as EMP candidates based on their medium-resolution (R ˜ 2000) spectra, and were followed up with high-resolution (R ˜  35,000) spectroscopy with the Magellan/Clay Telescope. Their derived chemical abundances exhibit good agreement with those of stars with similar metallicities. We also provide new insights on the formation of the UMP stars, based on comparisons with a new set of theoretical models of supernovae (SNe) nucleosynthesis. The models were matched with 20 UMP stars found in the literature, together with one of the program stars (SDSS J1204+1201), with [{Fe}/{{H}}]=-4.34. From fitting their abundances, we find that the SNe progenitors, for stars where carbon and nitrogen are measured, had masses ranging from 20.5 {M}&sun;  to 28 {M}&sun;  and explosion energies from 0.3 to 0.9× {10}51 {erg}. These results are highly sensitive to the carbon and nitrogen abundance determinations, which is one of the main drivers for a future high-resolution follow-up of UMP candidates. In addition, we are able to reproduce the different CNO abundance patterns found in UMP stars with a single progenitor type by varying its mass and explosion energy.

	Abstract = {Cold accretion is a primary growth mechanism of simulated galaxies, yet observational evidence of ``cold flows'' at redshifts where they should be most efficient (z = 2-4) is scarce. In simulations, cold streams manifest as Lyman-limit absorption systems (LLSs) with low heavy-element abundances similar to those of the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM). Here we report on an abundance survey of 17 H i-selected LLSs at z = 3.2-4.4 which exhibits no metal absorption in Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra. Using medium-resolution spectra obtained at Magellan, we derive ionization-corrected metallicities (or limits) with a Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling that accounts for the large uncertainty in NH i measurements typical of LLSs. The metal-poor LLS sample overlaps with the IGM in metallicity and can be described by a model where {71}-11+13% are drawn from the IGM chemical abundance distribution. These represent roughly half of all LLSs at these redshifts, suggesting that 28%-40% of the general LLS population at z ˜ 3.7 could trace accreting gas. An ancillary sample of ten LLSs without any a priori metal-line selection is fit by a model having {48}-12+14% of metallicities drawn from the IGM. We compare these results with regions of a moving-mesh simulation. The observed and simulated LLS metallicity distributions are in good agreement, after accounting for known uncertainties in both, with the fraction of simulated baryons in IGM-metallicity LLSs within a factor of two of the observed value. A statistically significant fraction of all LLSs have low metallicity and therefore represent candidates for accreting gas; large-volume simulations can establish what fraction of these candidates actually lie near galaxies and the observational prospects for detecting the presumed hosts in emission.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	Abstract = {We present an absorption-line survey of optically thick gas clouds---Lyman Limit Systems (LLSs)---observed at high dispersion with spectrometers on the Keck and Magellan telescopes. We measure column densities of neutral hydrogen {N}{{H} {{I}}} and associated metal-line transitions for 157 LLSs at {z}{LLS}=1.76-4.39 restricted to {10}17.3 {{cm}}-2<=slant {N}{{H} {{I}}}\lt {10}20.3 {{cm}}-2. An empirical analysis of ionic ratios indicates an increasing ionization state of the gas with decreasing {N}{{H} {{I}}} and that the majority of LLSs are highly ionized, confirming previous expectations. The Si+/H0 ratio spans nearly four orders of magnitude, implying a large dispersion in the gas metallicity. Fewer than 5% of these LLSs have no positive detection of a metal transition; by z˜ 3, nearly all gas that is dense enough to exhibit a very high Lyman limit opacity has previously been polluted by heavy elements. We add new measurements to the small subset of LLS (≈5%-10%) that may have super-solar abundances. High Si+/Fe+ ratios suggest an alpha-enhanced medium, whereas the Si+/C+ ratios do not exhibit the super-solar enhancement inferred previously for the Lyalpha forest.},

	Abstract = {We study the physical properties of a homogeneous sample of 157 optically thick absorption line systems at redshifts ˜1.8-4.4, selected from a high-dispersion spectroscopic survey of Lyman limit systems (LLSs). By means of multiple ionization models and Bayesian techniques, we derive the posterior probability distribution functions for the density, metallicity, temperature and dust content of the absorbing gas. We find that z > 2 LLSs are highly ionized with ionization parameters between -3 ≲ log U ≲ -2, depending on the H I column density. LLSs are characterized by low temperatures (T < 5 × 104K) and reside in dust-poor environments. Between z ˜ 2.5-3.5, ˜80 per cent of the LLSs have physical densities between nH ˜ 10- 3.5-10- 2 cm- 3 for the assumed UV background, but we caution that a degeneracy between the ionization parameter and the intensity of the radiation field prevents robust inference on the density and sizes of LLSs. Conversely, metallicity estimates are less sensitive to the assumptions behind ionization corrections. LLSs at z > 2 are characterized by a broad unimodal distribution over > 4 orders of magnitude, with a peak at log Z/Z&sun; ˜ -2. LLSs are metal poor, significantly less enriched than DLAs, with ˜70 per cent of the metallicity PDF below log Z/Z&sun; <= -1.5. The median metallicity of super LLSs with log N_{H I}>= 19 rapidly evolves with redshift, with a 10-fold increase between z ˜ 2.1-3.6 (˜1.5 Gyr). Based on this sample, we find that LLSs at z = 2.5-3.5 account for ˜15 per cent of all the metals produced by UV-selected galaxies. The implications for theories of cold gas accretion and metal ejection from galaxies are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The first stars, known as Population III (PopIII), produced the first heavy elements, thereby enriching their surrounding pristine gas. Previous detections of metals in intergalactic gas clouds, however, find a heavy element enrichment larger than 1/1000 times that of the solar environment, higher than expected for PopIII remnants. In this letter, we report the discovery of a Lyman limit system (LLS) at z = 3.53 with the lowest metallicity seen in gas with discernable metals, 10-3.41$\pm$0.26 times the solar value, at a level expected for PopIII remnants. We make the first relative abundance measurement in such low metallicity gas: the carbon-to-silicon ratio is 10-0.26$\pm$0.17 times the solar value. This is consistent with models of gas enrichment by a PopIII star formation event early in the Universe, but also consistent with later, Population II enrichment. The metals in all three components comprising the LLS, which has a velocity width of 400 km s-1, are offset in velocity by ˜+6 km s-1 from the bulk of the hydrogen, suggesting the LLS was enriched by a single event. Relative abundance measurements in this near-pristine regime open a new avenue for testing models of early gas enrichment and metal mixing.},

	Abstract = {We report on the observed properties of the plasma revealed through high signal-to-noise observations of 54 intervening O VI absorption systems containing 85 O VI and 133 H I components in a blind survey of 14 QSOs observed at ~18 km s-1 resolution with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph over a redshift path of 3.52 at z < 0.5. Simple systems with one or two H I components and one O VI component comprise 50% of the systems. For a sample of 45 well-aligned absorption components where the temperature can be estimated, we find evidence for cool photoionized gas in 31 (69%) and warm gas (6 > log T > 5) in 14 (31%) of the components. The total hydrogen content of the 14 warm components can be estimated from the temperature and the measured value of log N(H I). The very large implied values of log N(H) range from 18.38 to 20.38 with a median of 19.35. The metallicity, [O/H], in the 6 warm components with log T > 5.45 ranges from -1.93 to 0.03 with a median value of -1.0 dex. Ground-based galaxy redshift studies reveal that most of the absorbers we detect sample gas in the intergalactic medium extending 200 to 600 kpc beyond the closest associated galaxy. For the warm aligned O VI absorbers, we estimate Omegab(O VI)Warm = 0.0019 $\pm$ 0.0005 which corresponds to (4.1 $\pm$ 1.1)% of the baryons at low z. The warm plasma traced by the aligned O VI and H I absorption contains nearly as many baryons as are found in galaxies.  Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under NASA contract NAS5-2655, and the NASA-CNES/ESA Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer mission operated by Johns Hopkins University, supported by NASA contract NAS 05-32885.},

	Abstract = {A detailed description is given of the data analysis leading to the discovery of young massive star clusters (YMCs) in a sample of 21 nearby galaxies. A new useful tool, ishape, for the derivation of intrinsic shape parameters of compact objects is presented, and some test results are shown. Completeness tests for the cluster samples are discussed, and ishape is used to estimate cluster sizes. Half-light radii of 0-20 pc are derived for clusters in 2 of the most cluster-rich galaxies, NGC 1313 and NGC 5236, which is within the range spanned by globular clusters in the Milky Way and by YMCs in the LMC and some starburst galaxies. Photometric data for all clusters, along with positions and estimated half-light radii, are tabulated.

@article{tully2008,
	Abstract = {The peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies manifested in the cosmic microwave background dipole is found to decompose into three dominant components. The three components are clearly separated because they arise on distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their influences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at ~7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small, and we advocate a reference frame with respect to the Local Sheet in preference to the Local Group. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km s-1 and centered near the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components are 259, 185, and 455 km s-1, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km s-1 in the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into account, particularly that of the Local Void, causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion attributed to their pull. Concerning the motion of ~260 km s-1 away from the Local Void, given the velocities expected from gravitational instability theory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position. The Local Void is extremely large.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new, very deep neutral hydrogen (H i) survey being performed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). The Westerbork Hydrogen Accretion in LOcal GAlaxieS (HALOGAS) Survey is producing an archive of some of the most sensitive H i observations available, on the angular scales which are most useful for studying faint, diffuse gas in and around nearby galaxies. The survey data are being used to perform careful modeling of the galaxies, characterizing their gas content, morphology, and kinematics, with the primary goal of revealing the global characteristics of cold gas accretion onto spiral galaxies in the local Universe. In this paper, we describe the survey sample selection, the data acquisition, reduction, and analysis, and present the data products obtained during our pilot program, which consists of UGC 2082, NGC 672, NGC 925, and NGC 4565. The observations reveal a first glimpse of the picture that the full HALOGAS project aims to illuminate: the properties of accreting H i in different types of spirals, and across a range of galactic environments. None of the pilot survey galaxies hosts an H i halo of the scale of NGC 891, but all show varying indications of halo gas features. We compare the properties of detected features in the pilot survey galaxies with their global characteristics, and discuss similarities and differences with NGC 891 and NGC 2403.},

	Abstract = {The apparent age and mass of a stellar cluster can be strongly affected by stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), when inferred from the integrated color of low-mass clusters (lsim104 M &sun;). We use simulated star clusters to show that these effects are minimized when the brightest, rapidly evolving stars in a cluster can be resolved, and the light of the fainter, more numerous unresolved stars can be analyzed separately. When comparing the light from the less luminous cluster members to models of unresolved light, more accurate age estimates can be obtained than when analyzing the integrated light from the entire cluster under the assumption that the IMF is fully populated. We show the success of this technique first using simulated clusters, and then with a stellar cluster in M31. This method represents one way of accounting for the discrete, stochastic sampling of the stellar IMF in less massive clusters and can be leveraged in studies of clusters throughout the Local Group and other nearby galaxies.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{fouesneau2010,
	Abstract = {Context. Star clusters are studied widely both as benchmarks for stellar evolution models and in their own right. Cluster age distributions and mass distributions within galaxies are probes of star formation histories and of cluster formation and disruption processes. The vast majority of clusters in the Universe are small, and it is well known that the integrated fluxes and colours of all but the most massive ones have broad probability distributions, owing to small numbers of bright stars.  Aims: This paper goes beyond describing predicted probability distributions to present results of the analysis of cluster energy distributions in an explicitly stochastic context.  Methods: The method developed is Bayesian. It provides posterior probability distributions in the age-mass-extinction space, using multi-wavelength photometric observations and a large collection of Monte-Carlo simulations of clusters of finite stellar masses. The main priors are the assumed intrinsic distributions of current mass and current age for clusters in a galaxy. Both UBVI and UBVIK data sets are considered, and the study conducted in this paper is restricted to the solar metallicity.  Results: We first use the collection of simulations to reassess and explain errors arising from the use of standard analysis methods, which are based on continuous population synthesis models: systematic errors on ages and random errors on masses are large, while systematic errors on masses tend to be smaller. The age-mass distributions obtained after analysis of a synthetic sample are very similar to those found for real galaxies in the literature. The Bayesian approach, on the other hand, is very successful in recovering the input ages and masses over ages ranging between 20 Myr and 1.5 Gyr, with only limited systematics that we explain.  Conclusions: Considering stochasticity is important, more important for instance than the choice of adding or removing near-IR data in many cases. We found no immediately obvious reason to reject priors inspired by previous (standard) analyses of cluster populations in galaxies, i.e., cluster distributions that scale with mass as M-2 and are uniform on a logarithmic age scale.},

	Abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

	Abstract = {The Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) are two identical high-throughput optical low- to medium-resolution CCD spectrometers being deployed at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Operating in the 340-1000nm range, they use a large dichroic to split light into separately-optimized red and blue channels that feature reflective collimators and decentered Maksutov-Schmidt cameras with monolithic 8×3K CCD detectors. A parallel infrared laser closed-loop image motion compensation system nulls spectrograph flexure giving it high calibration stability. The two MODS instruments may be operated together with digital data combination as a single instrument giving the LBT an effective aperture of 11.8-meter, or separately configured to flexibly use the twin 8.4-meter apertures. This paper describes the properties and performance of the completed MODS1 instrument. MODS1 was delivered to LBT in May 2010 and is being prepared for first-light in September 2010.},

	Abstract = {NGC 4013 is a distinctly warped galaxy with evidence of disk-halo activity. Through deep H i observations and modeling we confirm that the H i disk is thin (central exponential scale height with an upper limit of 4" or 280 pc), but flaring. We detect a vertical gradient in rotation velocity (lag), which shallows radially from a value of -35{}-28+7 km s-1 kpc-1 at 1.'4 (5.8 kpc), to a value of zero near R25 (11.2 kpc). Over much of this radial range, the lag is relatively steep. Both the steepness and the radial shallowing are consistent with recent determinations for a number of edge-ons, which have been difficult to explain. We briefly consider the lag measured in NGC 4013 in the context of this larger sample and theoretical models, further illuminating disk-halo flows.},

	Abstract = {New grids of stellar evolutionary models covering the range of 0.8 to 120 solar masses have been computed for metallicites Z = 0.020 and Z = 0.001. The models use the new opacities by Rogers and Iglesias (1991) and by Kurucz (1991) at low T. The consequent changes in the solar helium content, in the mixing length ratio and in the overshooting parameter are taken into account after careful calibrations. Important physical ingredients as the nuclear reaction rates and the neutrino loss rates have been updated. The ionization of the main heavy elements is calculated in details. Results of the models are given in a compact way at corresponding evolutionary stages in each model. In addition to the tables, we shortly present some general results on the tracks in the HR diagrams, the lifetimes in the H-, He-, C-burning phases, and on massive and WR stars.},

@article{pandey2010,
	Abstract = {This paper presents integrated magnitudes and colours for synthetic clusters. The integrated parameters have been obtained for the whole cluster population as well as for the main-sequence (MS) population of star clusters. We have also estimated observed integrated magnitudes and colours of the MS population of galactic open clusters, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) star clusters. It is found that the colour evolution of the MS population of star clusters is not affected by the stochastic fluctuations, however, these fluctuations significantly affect the colour evolution of the whole cluster population. The fluctuations are maximum in (V - I) colour in the age range 6.7 < log(age) < 7.5. Evolution of integrated colours of the MS population of clusters in the Milky Way, LMC and SMC, obtained in the present study is well explained by the present synthetic cluster model. The observed integrated (B - V) colours of the MS population of LMC star clusters having age >=500 Myr seem to be distributed around the Z = 0.004 model, whereas (V - I) colours are found to be bluer than those predicted by the Z = 0.004 model. The (V - I) versus (B - V) two-colour diagram for the MS population of the Milky Way star clusters shows a fair agreement between the observations and present model, however, the diagrams for LMC and SMC clusters indicate that observed (V - I) colours are relatively bluer. Possible reasons for this anomaly have been discussed. Comparison of the synthetic (U - B) versus (B - V) relation with the observed integrated parameters of the whole cluster population of the Milky Way, LMC and SMC star clusters indicates that the majority of the bluest clusters [(B - V)0 < 0.0] follow the MS population relation. The colour evolution of young Milky Way, LMC and SMC clusters [6.5 <= log(age) <=8.0] also indicates that a large number of young clusters follow the MS population relation. Therefore, in the absence of a careful modelling of stochastic effects, age determination of young star clusters by comparing their integrated colours with whole cluster synthetic colours may yield erroneous results.},

Based on the parallax, we measure a distance of 389+24-21 pc to the source. Our measurement places the Orion Nebula Cluster considerably closer than the canonical distance of 480+/-80 pc determined by Genzel et al. A change of this magnitude in distance lowers the luminosities of the stars in the cluster by a factor of ~1.5. We briefly discuss two effects of this change-an increase in the age spread of the pre-main-sequence stars, and better agreement between the zero-age main sequence and the temperatures and luminosities of massive stars.},

	Abstract = {To examine whether a statistically viable relation between nebular luminosity and excitation parameter (U) exists, a sample of evolved galactic H II regions was selected for which the exciting stars have been identified. A 10 cm f/8 telescope with a speciality constructed photometer was used to obtain integrated H alpha and H beta fluxes for thirteen Sharpless H II regions. Combining these with previously measured fluxes yielded H alpha fluxes for 27 nebulae, and H beta fluxes for all but three of these. The results indicate that the uncertainty in the value of U calculated from radio continuum flux densities is about 20%. Using H alpha and H beta fluxes and a standard reddening law to correct for interstellar extinction results in an uncertainty of about 25 to 30% in U. In addition these random uncertainties, U is systematically underestimated by 20 to 25%. These results are applied to the spiral galaxy M83. The giant regions more concentrated in a two-armed spiral pattern than the nongiant regions, and have a more sharply peaked radial distribution function.},

	Abstract = {To further understand the origins of and physical processes operating in extra-planar gas, we present observations and kinematic models of H I in the two nearby, edge-on spiral galaxies NGC 3044 and NGC 4302. We model NGC 3044 as a single, thick disk. Substantial amounts of extra-planar H I are also detected. We detect a decrease in rotation speed with height (a lag) that shallows radially, reaching zero at approximately R 25. The large-scale kinematic asymmetry of the approaching and receding halves suggests a recent disturbance. The kinematics and morphology of NGC 4302, a Virgo Cluster member, are greatly disturbed. We model NGC 4302 as a combination of a thin disk and a second, thicker disk, the latter having a hole near the center. We detect lagging extra-planar gas, with indications of shallowing in the receding half, although its characteristics are difficult to constrain. A bridge is detected between NGC 4302 and its companion, NGC 4298. We explore trends involving the extra-planar H I kinematics of these galaxies, as well as galaxies throughout the literature, as well as possible connections between lag properties with star formation and environment. Measured lags are found to be significantly steeper than those modeled by purely ballistic effects, indicating additional factors. Radial shallowing of extra-planar lags is typical and occurs between 0.5R 25 and R 25, suggesting internal processes are important in dictating extra-planar kinematics.},

@article{garcia-burillo1999,
	Abstract = {The nucleus of the box-shaped galaxy NGC 4013 has been observed with the IRAM interferometer in the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines of (12) CO. Our maps show the existence of a fast-rotating (130 km s(-1) ) molecular gas disk of radius r ~ 2arcsec (110 pc). Several arguments support the existence of a bar potential in NGC 4013. The figure-of-eight pattern of the major axis p-v plot, the ring-like distribution of gas, and the existence of gas emission at non-circular velocities are best accounted by a bar. We have also detected gas at high z distances from the plane (z ~ 200-300pc=4arcsec -5arcsec ). The latter component is related to a system of 4 Halpha filaments of diffuse ionized gas that come out from the nucleus. The galactic fountain model seems the best to account for the Halpha and CO filaments. Although the peanut distortion can be spontaneously formed by a stellar bar in the disk, gas at high z might have been ejected after a nuclear starburst. The Halpha filaments start in the plane of the disk at r ~ 200 pc(4arcsec ), and reach several Kpc height at r ~ 600 pc(10arcsec ), coinciding with the maximum peanut distortion where the strength of the restoring forces of the plane have a minimum. We have critically examined other alternatives judged less probable: the existence of a CO warp (connected to the HI warping disk), the accretion of gas along stable inclined orbits and, finally, a vertical gas response near the resonances of the peanut (the latter is tested by numerical simulations). Although a link between the bar and the box-shaped bulge in NGC 4013 is suggested we find noticeable differences between the results of previous numerical simulations and the present observations. The discrepancy concerns the parameters of the bar generating the peanut. We see in NGC 4013 the existence of a strong ILR region. The inclusion of a dissipative component, which remains to be thoroughly studied, may change the evolution of the stellar peanut: although in simulations the peanut appears initially near a marginal ILR, the inflow of gas driven by the bar, can make two ILRs appear.},

	Abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mum map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mum data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mum map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected.  To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mum DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mum flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mum map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mum and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mum (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field.  The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mum emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

	Abstract = {We have observed NGC 5194 (M51a) as part of the CHemical Abundances of Spirals project. Using the Multi Object Double Spectrographs on the Large Binocular Telescope we are able to measure one or more of the temperature-sensitive auroral lines ([O iii] lambda4363, [N ii] lambda5755, [S iii] lambda6312) and thus measure ``direct'' gas-phase abundances in 29 individual H ii regions. [O iii] lambda4363 is only detected in two H ii regions, both of which show indications of excitation by shocks. We compare our data to previous direct abundances measured in NGC 5194 and find excellent agreement ({{Delta }}[{log}({{O}}/{{H}})]≈ 0.05) for all but one region. We find no evidence of trends in Ar/O, Ne/O, or S/O within NGC 5194 or compared to other galaxies. We find modest negative gradients in both O/H and N/O with very little scatter (sigma <= 0.08 dex), most of which can be attributed to random error and not to intrinsic dispersion. The gas-phase abundance gradient is consistent with the gradients observed in other interacting galaxies, which tend to be shallower than gradients measured in isolated galaxies. The N/O ratio (< {log}({{N}}/{{O}})> =-0.62) suggests secondary nitrogen production is responsible for a significantly larger fraction of nitrogen (e.g., factor of 8-10), relative to primary production mechanisms than predicted by theoretical models.},

@article{berg2015,
	Abstract = {The CHemical Abundances of Spirals (CHAOS) project leverages the combined power of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) with the broad spectral range and sensitivity of the Multi Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) to measure ``direct'' abundances (based on observations of the temperature-sensitive auroral lines) in large samples of H ii regions in spiral galaxies. We present LBT MODS observations of 62 H ii regions in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628, with an unprecedentedly large number of auroral lines measurements (18 [O iii] lambda4363, 29 [N ii] lambda5755, 40 [S iii]lambda6312, and 40 [O ii] lambdalambda7320, 7330 detections) in 45 H ii regions. Comparing derived temperatures from multiple auroral line measurements, we find: (1) a strong correlation between temperatures based on [S iii] lambda6312 and [N ii] lambda5755 and (2) large discrepancies for some temperatures based on [O ii] lambdalambda7320, 7330 and [O iii] lambda4363. Both of these trends are consistent with other observations in the literature, yet, given the widespread use and acceptance of [O iii] lambda4363 as a temperature determinant, the magnitude of the T[O iii] discrepancies still came as a surprise. Based on these results, we conduct a uniform abundance analysis prioritizing the temperatures derived from [S iii] lambda6312 and [N ii] lambda5755, and report the gas-phase abundance gradients for NGC 628. Relative abundances of S/O, Ne/O, and Ar/O are constant across the galaxy, consistent with no systematic change in the upper IMF over the sampled range in metallicity. These alpha-element ratios, along with N/O, all show small dispersions (sigma ~ 0.1 dex) over 70% of the azimuthally averaged radius. We interpret these results as an indication that, at a given radius, the interstellar medium in NGC 628 is chemically well-mixed. Unlike the gradients in the nearly temperature-independent relative abundances, O/H abundances have a larger intrinsic dispersion of ~0.165 dex. We posit that this dispersion represents an upper limit to the true dispersion in O/H at a given radius and that some of that dispersion is due to systematic uncertainties arising from temperature measurements.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate the presence of an extended and massive circumgalactic medium (CGM) around Messier 31 using archival HST Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ultraviolet spectroscopy of 18 QSOs projected within two virial radii of M31 ({{R}vir}=300 kpc). We detect absorption from Si iii at -300≲ {{v}LSR}≲ -150 km s-1 toward all three sightlines at R≲ 0.2{{R}vir}, 3 of 4 sightlines at 0.8≲ R/{{R}vir}≲ 1.1, and possibly 1 of 11 at 1.1\lt R/{{R}vir}≲ 1.8. We present several arguments that the gas at these velocities observed in these directions originates from the M31 CGM rather than the Local Group or Milky Way CGM or Magellanic Stream. We show that the dwarf galaxies located in the CGM of M31 have very similar velocities over similar projected distances from M31. We find a non-trivial relationship only at these velocities between the column densities (N) of all the ions and R, whereby N decreases with increasing R. At R\lt 0.8{{R}vir}, the covering fraction is close to unity for Si iii and C iv ({{f}c}˜ 60%-97% at the 90% confidence level), but drops to {{f}c}≲ 10%-20% at R≳ {{R}vir}. We show that the M31 CGM gas is bound, multiphase, predominantly ionized, and is more highly ionized gas at larger R. We estimate using Si ii, Si iii, and Si iv, a CGM metal mass of ≳ 2× {{10}6} M&sun;  and gas mass of ≳ 3× {{10}9}({{Z}&sun; }/Z) M&sun;  within 0.2{{R}vir}, and possibly a factor of ˜10 larger within {{R}vir}, implying substantial metal and gas masses in the CGM of M31.

	Abstract = {We present and make publicly available the first data release (DR1) of the Keck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorption toward Quasars (KODIAQ) survey. The KODIAQ survey is aimed at studying galactic and circumgalactic gas in absorption at high redshift, with a focus on highly ionized gas traced by O vi, using the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. KODIAQ DR1 consists of a fully reduced sample of 170 quasars at 0.29\lt {z}{em}\lt 5.29 observed with HIRES at high resolution (36,000 <= R <= 103,000) between 2004 and 2012. DR1 contains 247 spectra available in continuum normalized form, representing a sum total exposure time of ~1.6 megaseconds. These coadded spectra arise from a total of 567 individual exposures of quasars taken from the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) in raw form and uniformly processed using a publicly available HIRES data reduction package. DR1 is publicly available to the community, housed as a higher level science product at the KOA. We will provide future data releases that make available additional quasars, including those with pre-2004 observations taken with the previous-generation HIRES detectors.},

	Abstract = {We present the first results from our NASA Keck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorbers toward Quasars (KODIAQ) survey which aims to characterize the properties of the highly ionized gas of galaxies and their circumgalactic medium (CGM) at 2 < z < 4. We select absorbers optically thick at the Lyman limit (tauLL > 1, log N_{H\,\scriptsize{I}} \textgreater 17.3) as probes of these galaxies and their CGM where both transitions of the O VI doublet have little contamination from the Lyalpha, beta forests. We found 20 absorbers that satisfy these rules: 7 Lyman limit systems (LLSs), 8 super-LLSs (SLLSs) and 5 damped Lyalpha (DLAs). The O VI detection rate is 100% for the DLAs, 71% for the LLSs, and 63% for the SLLSs. When O VI is detected, log \langle N_{O\,\scriptsize{VI}} \rangle = 14.9 +/- 0.3, an average O VI column density substantially larger and with a smaller dispersion than found in blind O VI surveys at similar redshifts. Strong O VI absorption is therefore nearly ubiquitous in the CGM of z ~ 2-3 galaxies. The total velocity widths of the O VI profiles are also large (200 \le \Delta v_{O\,\scriptsize{VI}} \le 400 km s-1). These properties are quite similar to those seen for O VI in low-z star-forming galaxies, and therefore we hypothesize that these strong CGM O VI absorbers (with tauLL > 1) at 2 < z <~ 3.5 also probe outflows of star-forming galaxies. The LLSs and SLLSs with no O VI absorption have properties consistent with those seen in cosmological simulations tracing cold streams feeding galaxies. When the highly ionized (Si IV and O VI) gas is taken into account, we determine that the tauLL > 1 absorbers could contain as much as 3%-14% of the cosmic baryon budget at z ~ 2-3, only second to the Lyalpha forest. We conservatively show that 5%-20% of the metals ever produced at z ~ 2-3 are in form of highly ionized metals ejected in the CGM of galaxies.  We dedicate this paper and the KODIAQ project to the memory and families of Wal Sargent and Arthur M. Wolfe. Without the vision and terrific efforts of these two scientists, this survey would not exist. Their careers have greatly inspired and influenced our own, and we hope that their work continues to flourish with this archival data set.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic interactions between the two Magellanic Clouds have flung large quantities of gas into the halo of the Milky Way. The result is a spectacular arrangement of gaseous structures, including the Magellanic Stream, the Magellanic Bridge, and the Leading Arm (collectively referred to as the Magellanic System). In this third paper of a series studying the Magellanic gas in absorption, we analyze the gas ionization level using a sample of 69 Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph sightlines that pass through or within 30$\,^{\circ}$ of the 21 cm emitting regions. We find that 81% (56/69) of the sightlines show UV absorption at Magellanic velocities, indicating that the total cross-section of the Magellanic System is ≈11,000 deg2, or around one-quarter of the entire sky. Using observations of the Si III/Si II ratio together with Cloudy photoionization modeling, we calculate the total gas mass (atomic plus ionized) of the Magellanic System to be ≈2.0 × 109 M &sun; (d/55 kpc)2, with the ionized gas contributing around three times as much mass as the atomic gas. This is larger than the current-day interstellar H I mass of both Magellanic Clouds combined, indicating that they have lost most of their initial gas mass. If the gas in the Magellanic System survives to reach the Galactic disk over its inflow time of ~0.5-1.0 Gyr, it will represent an average inflow rate of ~3.7-6.7 M &sun; yr-1, potentially raising the Galactic star formation rate. However, multiple signs of an evaporative interaction with the hot Galactic corona indicate that the Magellanic gas may not survive its journey to the disk fully intact and will instead add material to (and cool) the corona.

	Abstract = {We report the detection of absorption from interstellar C2 and C3 towards the moderately reddened star Sk 143, located in the near `wing' region of the SMC, in optical spectra obtained with the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph. These detections of C2 (rotational levels J = 0-8) and C3 (J = 0-12) absorption in the SMC are the first beyond our Galaxy. The total abundances of C2 and C3 (relative to H2) are similar to those found in diffuse Galactic molecular clouds - as previously found for CH and CN - despite the significantly lower average metallicity of the Small Magellanic Cloud. Analysis of the rotational excitation of C2 yields an estimated kinetic temperature Tk ˜ 25 K and a moderately high total hydrogen density nH ˜ 870 cm-3 - compared to the T01 ˜ 45 K and nH ˜ 85-300 cm-3 obtained from H2. The populations of the lower rotational levels of C3 are consistent with an excitation temperature of about 34 K.},

	Abstract = {Studies of QSO absorber-galaxy connections are often hindered by inadequate information on whether faint/dwarf galaxies are located near the QSO sight lines. To investigate the contribution of faint galaxies to QSO absorber populations, we are conducting a deep galaxy redshift survey near low-z C IV absorbers. Here we report a blindly detected C IV absorption system (z abs = 0.00348) in the spectrum of PG1148+549 that appears to be associated either with an edge-on dwarf galaxy with an obvious disk (UGC 6894, z gal = 0.00283) at an impact parameter of rho = 190 kpc or with a very faint dwarf irregular galaxy at rho = 23 kpc, which is closer to the sightline but has a larger redshift difference (z gal = 0.00107, i.e., deltav = 724 km s-1). We consider various gas/galaxy associations, including infall and outflows. Based on current theoretical models, we conclude that the absorber is most likely tracing (1) the remnants of an outflow from a previous epoch, a so-called "ancient outflow", or (2) intergalactic gas accreting onto UGC 6894, "cold mode" accretion. The latter scenario is supported by H I synthesis imaging data that shows the rotation curve of the disk being codirectional with the velocity offset between UGC 6894 and the absorber, which is located almost directly along the major axis of the edge-on disk.  Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope operated at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. Also, based on data acquired using the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The LBT is an international collaboration among institutions in the US, Italy, and Germany. LBT Corporation partners are the University of Arizona, on behalf of the Arizona University System; Instituto Nazionale do Astrofisica, Italy; LBT Beteiligungsgesellschaft, Germany, representing the Max Planck Society, the Astrophysical Institute of Potsdam, and Heidelberg University; Ohio State University, and the Research Corporation, on behalf of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Virginia.

	Abstract = {We study the high-ion content and kinematics of the circumgalactic medium around low-redshift galaxies using a sample of 23 Lyman limit systems (LLSs) at 0.08 < z < 0.93 observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. In Lehner et al., we recently showed that low-z LLSs have a bimodal metallicity distribution. Here we extend that analysis to search for differences between the high-ion and kinematic properties of the metal-poor and metal-rich branches. We find that metal-rich LLSs tend to show higher O VI columns and broader O VI profiles than metal-poor LLSs. The total H I line width (Deltav 90 statistic) in LLSs is not correlated with metallicity, indicating that the H I kinematics alone cannot be used to distinguish inflow from outflow and gas recycling. Among the 17 LLSs with O VI detections, all but two show evidence of kinematic sub-structure, in the form of O VI-H I centroid offsets, multiple components, or both. Using various scenarios for how the metallicities in the high-ion and low-ion phases of each LLS compare, we constrain the ionized hydrogen column in the O VI phase to lie in the range log N(H II) ~ 17.6-20. The O VI phase of LLSs is a substantial baryon reservoir, with M(high-ion) ~ 108.5-10.9 (r/150 kpc)2 M &sun;, similar to the mass in the low-ion phase. Accounting for the O VI phase approximately doubles the contribution of low-z LLSs to the cosmic baryon budget.  Based on observations taken under programs 11508, 11520, 11541, 11598, 11692, 11741, 12025, 12038, and 12466 of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We present a multi-wavelength study of the Magellanic Stream (MS), a massive gaseous structure in the Local Group that is believed to represent material stripped from the Magellanic Clouds. We use ultraviolet, optical and radio data obtained with HST/COS, VLT/UVES, FUSE, GASS, and ATCA to study metal abundances and physical conditions in the Stream toward the quasar Fairall 9. Line absorption in the MS from a large number of metal ions and from molecular hydrogen is detected in up to seven absorption components, indicating the presence of multi-phase gas. From the analysis of unsaturated S II absorption, in combination with a detailed photoionization model, we obtain a surprisingly high alpha abundance in the Stream toward Fairall 9 of [S/H] = -0.30 $\pm$ 0.04 (0.50 solar). This value is five times higher than what is found along other MS sightlines based on similar COS/UVES data sets. In contrast, the measured nitrogen abundance is found to be substantially lower ([N/H] = -1.15 $\pm$ 0.06), implying a very low [N/alpha] ratio of -0.85 dex. The substantial differences in the chemical composition of MS toward Fairall 9 compared to other sightlines point toward a complex enrichment history of the Stream. We favor a scenario, in which the gas toward Fairall 9 was locally enriched with alpha elements by massive stars and then was separated from the Magellanic Clouds before the delayed nitrogen enrichment from intermediate-mass stars could set in. Our results support (but do not require) the idea that there is a metal-enriched filament in the Stream toward Fairall 9 that originates in the LMC.  Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) for the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5D26555, and on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile under Program ID 085.C-0172(A).},

	Abstract = {The Magellanic Stream (MS) is a massive and extended tail of multi-phase gas stripped out of the Magellanic Clouds and interacting with the Galactic halo. In this first paper of an ongoing program to study the Stream in absorption, we present a chemical abundance analysis based on HST/COS and VLT/UVES spectra of four active galactic nuclei (RBS 144, NGC 7714, PHL 2525, and HE 0056-3622) lying behind the MS. Two of these sightlines yield good MS metallicity measurements: toward RBS 144 we measure a low MS metallicity of [S/H] = [S II/H I] = -1.13 $\pm$ 0.16 while toward NGC 7714 we measure [O/H] = [O I/H I] = -1.24 $\pm$ 0.20. Taken together with the published MS metallicity toward NGC 7469, these measurements indicate a uniform abundance of ≈0.1 solar along the main body of the Stream. This provides strong support to a scenario in which most of the Stream was tidally stripped from the SMC ≈ 1.5-2.5 Gyr ago (a time at which the SMC had a metallicity of ≈0.1 solar), as predicted by several N-body simulations. However, in Paper II of this series, we report a much higher metallicity (S/H = 0.5 solar) in the inner Stream toward Fairall 9, a direction sampling a filament of the MS that Nidever et al. claim can be traced kinematically to the Large Magellanic Cloud, not the Small Magellanic Cloud. This shows that the bifurcation of the Stream is evident in its metal enrichment, as well as its spatial extent and kinematics. Finally we measure a similar low metallicity [O/H] = [O I/H I] = -1.03 $\pm$ 0.18 in the v LSR = 150 km s-1 cloud toward HE 0056-3622, which belongs to a population of anomalous velocity clouds near the south Galactic pole. This suggests these clouds are associated with the Stream or more distant structures (possibly the Sculptor Group, which lies in this direction at the same velocity), rather than tracing foreground Galactic material.  Based on observations taken under program 12604 of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555, and under proposal ID 085.C-0172(A) with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Unit 2 (Kueyen) operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) at Paranal, Chile.},

	Abstract = {We assess the metal content of the cool (~104 K) circumgalactic medium (CGM) about galaxies at z <~ 1 using an H I-selected sample of 28 Lyman limit systems (LLS; defined here as absorbers with 16.2 <~ log N H I  <~ 18.5) observed in absorption against background QSOs by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The N H I  selection avoids metallicity biases inherent in many previous studies of the low-redshift CGM. We compare the column densities of weakly ionized metal species (e.g., O II, Si II, Mg II) to N H I  in the strongest H I component of each absorber. We find that the metallicity distribution of the LLS (and hence the cool CGM) is bimodal with metal-poor and metal-rich branches peaking at [X/H] ~= -1.6 and -0.3 (or about 2.5% and 50% solar metallicities). The cool CGM probed by these LLS is predominantly ionized. The metal-rich branch of the population likely traces winds, recycled outflows, and tidally stripped gas; the metal-poor branch has properties consistent with cold accretion streams thought to be a major source of fresh gas for star forming galaxies. Both branches have a nearly equal number of absorbers. Our results thus demonstrate there is a significant mass of previously undiscovered cold metal-poor gas and confirm the presence of metal enriched gas in the CGM of z <~ 1 galaxies.

	Abstract = {Using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ultraviolet spectra of the z em = 0.9754 quasar PG1148+549 obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope, we study the physical conditions and abundances of Ne VIII+O VI absorption line systems at z abs = 0.68381, 0.70152, 0.72478. In addition to Ne VIII and O VI, absorption lines from multiple ionization stages of oxygen (O II, O III, O IV) are detected and are well aligned with the more highly ionized species. We show that these absorbers are multiphase systems including hot gas (T ≈ 105.7 K) that produces Ne VIII and O VI, and the gas metallicity of the cool phase ranges from Z = 0.3 Z &sun; to supersolar. The cool (≈104 K) phases have densities nH ≈ 10-4 cm-3 and small sizes (<4 kpc) these cool clouds are likely to expand and dissipate, and the Ne VIII may be within a transition layer between the cool gas and a surrounding, much hotter medium. The Ne VIII redshift density, d {N}/dz\sim 7^{+7}_{-3}, requires a large number of these clouds for every L > 0.1 L* galaxy and a large effective absorption cross section (gsim 100 kpc), and indeed, we find a star-forming ~L sstarf galaxy at the redshift of the z abs = 0.72478 system, at an impact parameter of 217 kpc. Multiphase absorbers like these Ne VIII systems are likely to be an important reservoir of baryons and metals in the circumgalactic media of galaxies.

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution, optical images (BVI + Halpha) of the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) in the thick disks of the edge-on spiral galaxies NGC 4013 and NGC 4302. Our images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Large Binocular Telescope, and WIYN 3.5 m telescope reveal an extensive population of filamentary dust absorption seen to z ~2-2.5 kpc. Many of these dusty thick disk structures have characteristics reminiscent of molecular clouds found in the Milky Way disk. Our Halpha images show that the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in these galaxies is dominated by a smooth, diffuse component. The strongly filamentary morphologies of the dust absorption have no counterpart in the smoothly distributed Halpha emission. We argue that the thick disk DIG and dust-bearing filaments trace physically distinct phases of the thick disk ISM, the latter tracing a dense, warm or cold neutral medium. The dense, dusty matter in the thick disks of spiral galaxies is largely tracing matter ejected from the thin disk via energetic feedback from massive stars. The high densities of the gas may be a result of converging gas flows. This dense material fuels some thick disk star formation, as evidenced by the presence of thick disk H II regions.

	Abstract = {The primordial abundances of light elements produced in the standard theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) depend only on the cosmic ratio of baryons to photons, a quantity inferred from observations of the microwave background. The predicted primordial 7Li abundance is four times that measured in the atmospheres of Galactic halo stars. This discrepancy could be caused by modification of surface lithium abundances during the stars' lifetimes or by physics beyond the Standard Model that affects early nucleosynthesis. The lithium abundance of low-metallicity gas provides an alternative constraint on the primordial abundance and cosmic evolution of lithium that is not susceptible to the in situ modifications that may affect stellar atmospheres. Here we report observations of interstellar 7Li in the low-metallicity gas of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a nearby galaxy with a quarter the Sun's metallicity. The present-day 7Li abundance of the Small Magellanic Cloud is nearly equal to the BBN predictions, severely constraining the amount of possible subsequent enrichment of the gas by stellar and cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis. Our measurements can be reconciled with standard BBN with an extremely fine-tuned depletion of stellar Li with metallicity. They are also consistent with non-standard BBN.},

	Abstract = {High-velocity clouds (HVCs), fast-moving ionized and neutral gas clouds found at high galactic latitudes, may play an important role in the evolution of the Milky Way. The extent of this role depends sensitively on their distances and total sky covering factor. We search for HVC absorption in Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectra of a carefully selected sample of 133 active galactic nuclei (AGN) using a range of atomic species in different ionization stages (e.g. O I, C II, C IV, Si II, Si III, Si IV). This allows us to identify neutral, weakly ionized or highly ionized HVCs over several decades in H I column densities. The sky covering factor of UV-selected HVCs with |vLSR| >= 90 km s-1 is about 68 per cent for the Galactic sky at |b|≳20o. About 74 per cent of the HVC directions have N(H i)<3×1018 cm-2 and 46 per cent have N(H i)<8×1017 cm-2. We show that our survey is essentially complete, i.e. an undetected population of HVCs with extremely low H (H I + H II) column density is unlikely to be important for the HVC mass budget. We confirm that the predominantly ionized HVCs contain at least as much mass as the traditional H I HVCs and show that large H I HVC complexes have generally ionized envelopes extending far from the H I contours. There are also large regions of the Galactic sky that are covered with ionized high-velocity gas with little H I emission nearby. We show that the covering factors of HVCs with 90<=|v LSR |≲170 km s-1 drawn from the AGN and stellar (with stars at d > 3 kpc) samples are similar. This confirms that most of the HVCs are within 5-15 kpc of the sun. The HVCs with |vLSR |≳170 km s-1 are largely associated with the Magellanic Stream at b < -20$\,^{\circ}$ and its leading arm at b > 20$\,^{\circ}$ as well as other large known H I complexes. We conclude that there is no evidence in the Local Group that any galaxy shows a population of HVCs extending much farther away than 50 kpc from its host, except possibly for those tracing remnants of galaxy interaction.

	Abstract = {We present direct measures of the ionization fractions of several sulfur ions in the Galactic warm ionized medium (WIM). We obtained high-resolution ultraviolet absorption-line spectroscopy of post-asymptotic giant branch stars in the globular clusters Messier 3 [(l, b) = (42fdg2, +78fdg7), d = 10.2 kpc, and z = 10.0 kpc] and Messier 5 [(l, b) = (3fdg9, +46fdg8), d = 7.5 kpc, and z = +5.3 kpc] with the Hubble Space Telescope and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer to measure, or place limits on, the column densities of S I, S II, S III, S IV, S VI, and H I. These clusters also house millisecond pulsars, whose dispersion measures give an electron column density from which we infer the H II column in these directions. We find fractions of S+2 in the WIM for the M 3 and M 5 sight lines x(S+2) ≡ N(S+2)/N(S) = 0.33 $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.47 $\pm$ 0.09, respectively, with variations perhaps related to location. With negligible quantities of the higher ionization states, we conclude that S+ and S+2 account for all of the S in the WIM. We extend the methodology to study the ion fractions in the warm and hot ionized gas of the Milky Way, including the high ions Si+3, C+3, N+4, and O+5. The vast majority of the Galactic ionized gas is warm (T ~ 104 K) and photoionized (the WIM) or very hot (T > 4 × 105 K) and collisionally ionized. The common tracer of ionized gas beyond the Milky Way, O+5, traces <1% of the total ionized gas mass of the Milky Way.

	Abstract = {Without a source of new gas, our Galaxy would exhaust its supply of gas through the formation of stars. Ionized gas clouds observed at high velocity may be a reservoir of such gas, but their distances are key for placing them in the galactic halo and unraveling their role. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to blindly search for ionized high-velocity clouds (iHVCs) in the foreground of galactic stars. We show that iHVCs with 90 <= |vLSR| ≲ 170 kilometers per second (where vLSR is the velocity in the local standard of rest frame) are within one galactic radius of the Sun and have enough mass to maintain star formation, whereas iHVCs with |vLSR| ≳ 170 kilometers per second are at larger distances. These may be the next wave of infalling material.},

	Abstract = {Outflowing winds of multiphase plasma have been proposed to regulate the buildup of galaxies, but key aspects of these outflows have not been probed with observations. By using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, we show that ``warm-hot'' plasma at 105.5 kelvin contains 10 to 150 times more mass than the cold gas in a post-starburst galaxy wind. This wind extends to distances > 68 kiloparsecs, and at least some portion of it will escape. Moreover, the kinematical correlation of the cold and warm-hot phases indicates that the warm-hot plasma is related to the interaction of the cold matter with a hotter (unseen) phase at >>106 kelvin. Such multiphase winds can remove substantial masses and alter the evolution of post-starburst galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present UV and optical observations from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck of a z = 0.27395 Lyman limit system (LLS) seen in absorption against the QSO PG1630+377. We detect H I absorption with log N(H I) = 17.06 $\pm$ 0.05 as well as Mg II, C III, Si III, and O VI in this system. The column densities are readily explained if this is a multi-phase system, with the intermediate and low ions arising in a very low metallicity ([Mg/H] = -1.71 $\pm$ 0.06) photoionized gas. We identify via Keck spectroscopy and Large Binocular Telescope imaging a 0.3 L * star-forming galaxy projected 37 kpc from the QSO at nearly identical redshift (z = 0.27406 and Deltav = -26 km s-1) with near solar metallicity ([O/H] = -0.20 $\pm$ 0.15). The presence of very low metallicity gas in the proximity of a near-solar metallicity, sub-L * galaxy strongly suggests that the LLS probes gas infalling onto the galaxy. A search of the literature reveals that such low-metallicity LLSs are not uncommon. We found that 50% (4/8) of the well-studied z <~ 1 LLSs have metallicities similar to the present system and show sub-L * galaxies with rho < 100 kpc in those fields where redshifts have been surveyed. We argue that the properties of these primitive LLSs and their host galaxies are consistent with those of cold mode accretion streams seen in galaxy simulations.

	Abstract = {We present a survey for optically thick Lyman limit absorbers at z < 2.6 using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations with the Faint Object Spectrograph and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. We identify 206 Lyman limit systems (LLSs), increasing the number of cataloged LLSs at z < 2.6 by a factor of ~10. We compile a statistical sample of 50 tauLLS >= 2 LLSs drawn from 249 QSO sight lines that avoid known targeting biases. The incidence of such LLSs per unit redshift, l(z) = dn/dz, at these redshifts is well described by a single power law, l(z)vprop(1 + z)gamma, with gamma = 1.33 $\pm$ 0.61 at z < 2.6, or with gamma = 1.83 $\pm$ 0.21 over the redshift range 0.2 <= z <= 4.9. The incidence of LLSs per absorption distance, l(X), decreases by a factor of ~1.5 over the ~0.6 Gyr from z = 4.9 to 3.5; l(X) evolves much more slowly at low redshifts, decreasing by a similar factor over the ~8 Gyr from z = 2.6 to 0.25. We show that the column density distribution function, f(N H I ), at low redshift is not well fitted by a single power-law index (f(N H I ) vprop N -beta H I ) over the column density range 13 <= log N H I  <= 22 or log N H I  >= 17.2. While low- and high-redshift f(N H I ) distributions are consistent for log N H I >19.0, there is some evidence that f(N H I ) evolves with z for log N H I  <~ 17.7, possibly due to the evolution of the UV background and galactic feedback. Assuming LLSs are associated with individual galaxies, we show that the physical cross section of the optically thick envelopes of galaxies decreased by a factor of ~9 from z ~ 5 to 2 and has remained relatively constant since that time. We argue that a significant fraction of the observed population of LLSs arises in the circumgalactic gas of sub-L * galaxies.

	Abstract = {The cooling transition temperature gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), traced by the high ions, Si IV, C IV, N V, and O VI, helps to constrain the flow of energy from the hot ISM with T>106 K to the warm ISM with T < 2 × 104 K. We investigate the properties of this gas along the lines of sight to 38 stars in the Milky Way disk using 1.5-2.7 km s-1 resolution spectra of Si IV, C IV, and N V absorption from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, and 15 km s-1 resolution spectra of O VI absorption from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. The absorption by Si IV and C IV exhibits broad and narrow components while only broad components are seen in N V and O VI. The narrow components imply gas with T < 7 × 104 K and trace two distinct types of gas. The strong, saturated, and narrow Si IV and C IV components trace the gas associated with the vicinities of O-type stars and their supershells. The weaker narrow Si IV and C IV components trace gas in the general ISM that is photoionized by the EUV radiation from cooling hot gas or has radiatively cooled in a non-equilibrium manner from the transition temperature phase, but rarely the warm-ionized medium probed by Al III. The broad Si IV, C IV, N V, and O VI components trace collisionally ionized gas that is very likely undergoing a cooling transition from the hot ISM to the warm ISM. The cooling process possibly provides the regulation mechanism that produces langN(C IV)/N(Si IV)rang = 3.9 $\pm$ 1.9. The cooling process also produces absorption lines where the median and mean values of the line widths increase with the energy required to create the ion.

	Abstract = {We analyze images of BIMA 12CO (J = 1 --> 0) , Very Large Array H I, and Spitzer 3.6 and 24 mum emission toward the edge-on galaxy NGC 891 and derive the radial and vertical distributions of gas and the radial distributions of stellar mass and recent star formation. We describe our method of deriving radial profiles for edge-on galaxies, assuming circular motion, and verify basic relationships between star formation rate (SFR) and gas and stellar content, and between the molecular-to-atomic ratio and hydrostatic midplane pressure that have been found in other galaxy samples. The Schmidt law index we find for the total gas (H2 + H I) is 0.85 $\pm$ 0.55, but the Schmidt law provides a poor description of the SFR in comparison to a model that includes the influence of the stellar disk. Using our measurements of the thickness of the gas disk and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, we estimate volume densities and pressures as a function of radius and height in order to test the importance of pressure in controlling the rho_{H_2}/rho_H I ratio. The gas pressure in two dimensions P(r, z) using constant velocity dispersion does not seem to correlate with the rho_{H_2}/rho_H I ratio, but the pressure using varying velocity dispersion appears to correlate with the ratio. We test the importance of gravitational instability in determining the sites of massive star formation and find that the Q parameter using a radially varying gas velocity dispersion is consistent with self-regulation (Q ~ 1) over a large part of the disk.},

	Abstract = {Previous Hubble Space Telescope and FUSE observations have revealed highly ionized high-velocity clouds (HVCs) or more generally low H I column HVCs along extragalactic sight lines over 70%-90% of the sky. The distances of these HVCs have remained largely unknown hindering from distinguishing a "Galactic" origin (e.g., outflow, inflow) from a "Local Group" origin (e.g., warm-hot intergalactic medium). We present the first detection of highly ionized HVCs in the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectrum of the early-type star HS 1914+7134 (l = 103$\,^{\circ}$, b = +24$\,^{\circ}$) located in the outer region of the Galaxy at d ~= 14.9 kpc. Two HVCs are detected in absorption at v LSR = -118 and -180 km s-1 in several species, including C IV, Si IV, Si III, Al II, C II, Si II, O I, but H I 21 cm emission is only seen at -118 km s-1. Within 17$\,^{\circ}$ of HS 1914+7134, we found HVC absorption of low and high ions at similar velocities toward five extragalactic sight lines, suggesting that these HVCs are related. The component at -118 km s-1 is likely associated with the outer arm of the Milky Way. The highly ionized HVC at -180 km s-1 is possibly an HVC plunging at high speed onto the thick disk of the Milky Way. This is the second detection of highly ionized HVCs toward Galactic stars, supporting a "Galactic" origin for at least some of these low H I column density HVCs.

	Abstract = {We report on an attempt to accurately wavelength calibrate four nights of data taken with the Keck HIRES spectrograph on QSO PHL957, for the purpose of determining whether the fine structure constant was different in the past. Using new software and techniques, we measured the redshifts of various Ni II, Fe II, Si II, etc. lines in a damped Lyalpha system at z = 2.309. Roughly half the data were taken through the Keck iodine cell which contains thousands of well calibrated iodine lines. Using these iodine exposures to calibrate the normal Th-Ar Keck data pipeline output, we found absolute wavelength offsets of 500 m s-1 to 1000 m s-1 with drifts of more than 500 m s-1 over a single night, and drifts of nearly 2000 m s-1 over several nights. These offsets correspond to an absolute redshift of uncertainty of about Deltaz ≈ 10-5(Deltalambda ≈ 0.02 {\AA}), with daily drifts of around Deltaz ≈ 5 × 10-6 (Deltalambda ≈ 0.01 {\AA}), and multiday drifts of nearly Deltaz ≈ 2 × 10-5(≈0.04 {\AA}). The causes of the wavelength offsets are not known, but since claimed shifts in the fine structure constant would result in velocity shifts of less than 100 m s-1, this level of systematic uncertainty may make it difficult to use Keck HIRES data to constrain the change in the fine structure constant. Using our calibrated data, we applied both our own fitting software and standard fitting software to measure Delta alpha \over alpha, but discovered that we could obtain results ranging from significant detection of either sign, to strong null limits, depending upon which sets of lines and which fitting method were used. We thus speculate that the discrepant results on Delta alpha \over alpha reported in the literature may be due to random fluctuations coming from underestimated systematic errors in wavelength calibration and fitting procedure.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of the intervening OVI absorption-line system at zabs = 0.495096 towards the quasi-stellar object (QSO) PKS 0405-123 (zem = 0.5726) obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. In addition to strong OVI, with , and moderate HI, with , this absorber shows absorption from CIII, NIV, OIV and OV, with upper limits for another seven ions. The large number of available ions allows us to test ionization models usually adopted with far fewer constraints. We find that the observed ionic column densities cannot be matched by single-temperature collisional ionization models, in or out of equilibrium. Photoionization models can match all of the observed column densities, including OVI. If one assumes photoionization by an ultraviolet (UV) background dominated by QSOs, the metallicity of the gas is [O/H] ~ -0.15, while if one assumes a model for the UV background with contributions from ionizing photons escaping from galaxies the metallicity is [O/H] ~ -0.62. Both give [N/O] ~ -0.6 and [C/H] ~ -0.2 to ~-0.1, though a solar C/O ratio is not ruled out. The choice of ionizing spectrum is poorly constrained and leads to systematic abundance uncertainties of ~0.5 dex, despite the wide range of available ions. Multiphase models with a contribution from both photoionized gas (at T ~ 104 K) and collisionally ionized gas [at T ~ (1-3) × 105 K] can also match the observations for either assumed UV background giving very similar metallicities. We do not detect NeVIII or MgX absorption. The limit on NeVIII/OVI < 0.21 (3sigma) is the lowest yet observed. Thus, this absorber shows no firm evidence of the `warm-hot intergalactic medium' at T ~ (0.5-3) × 106K thought to contain a significant fraction of the baryons at low redshift. The OVI in this system is not necessarily a reliable tracer of the warm-hot intergalactic medium given the ambiguity in its origins. We present limits on the total column of warm-hot gas in this absorber as a function of temperature. This system would be unlikely to provide detectable X-ray absorption in the ions OVII or OVIII even if it resided in front of the brighter X-ray sources in the sky.

	Abstract = {In the spectra of 139 early-type Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) stars observed with Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and with deep radio Parkes H I 21 cm observations along with those stars, we search for and analyze the absorption and emission from high-velocity gas at +90 <= v LSR <= +175 km s-1. The H I column density of the high-velocity clouds (HVCs) along these sightlines ranges from <1018.4 to 1019.2 cm-2. The incidence of the HVC metal absorption is 70%, significantly higher than the H I emission occurrence of 32%. We find that the mean metallicity of the HVC is [O I/H I] = -0.51 $\pm$ 0.12 0.16. There is no strong evidence for a large variation in the HVC metallicity, implying that these HVCs have a similar origin and are part of the same complex. The mean and scatter of the HVC metallicities are more consistent with the present-day LMC oxygen abundance than that of the Small Magellanic Cloud or the MW. We find that on average [Si II/O I] = +0.48 $\pm$ 0.15 0.25 and [Fe II/O I] = +0.33 $\pm$ 0.14 0.21, implying that the HVC complex is dominantly ionized. The HVC complex has a multiphase structure with neutral (O I, Fe II), weakly ionized (Fe II, N II), and highly ionized (O VI) components, and has evidence of dust but no molecules. All the observed properties of the HVC can be explained by an energetic outflow from the LMC. This is the first example of a large (>106 M sun) HVC complex that is linked to stellar feedback occurring in a dwarf spiral galaxy.

	Abstract = {With a column density log N(O VI) = 14.95 $\pm$ 0.05, the O VI absorber at z abs sime 0.2028 observed toward the quasi-stellar object PKS 0312-77 (z em = 0.223) is the strongest yet detected at z < 0.5. At nearly identical redshift (z abs sime 0.2026), we also identify a Lyman limit system (LLS, log N(H I) = 18.22+0.19 -0.25). Combining FUV and NUV spectra of PKS 0312-77 with optical observations of galaxies in the surrounding field (15' × 32'), we present an analysis of these absorbers and their connection to galaxies. The observed O I/H I ratio and photoionization modeling of other low ions indicate that the metallicity of the LLS is [Z/H]LLS sime -0.6, and that the LLS is nearly 100% photoionized. In contrast, the O VI-bearing gas is collisionally ionized at T ~ (3-10) × 105 K as derived from the high-ion ratios and profile broadenings. Our galaxy survey reveals 13 (0.3 lsim L/L * lsim 1.6) galaxies at rho < 2h -1 70 Mpc and |deltav| lsim 1100 km s-1 from the LLS. A probable origin for the LLS is debris from a galaxy merger, which led to a 0.7 L * galaxy ([Z/H]gal sime +0.15) at rho sime 38h -1 70 kpc. Outflow from this galaxy may also be responsible for the supersolar ([Z/H]abs sime +0.15), fully ionized absorber at z abs sime 0.2018 (-190 km s-1 from the LLS). The hot O VI absorber likely probes coronal gas about the 0.7 L * galaxy and/or (~0.1 keV) intragroup gas of a spiral-rich system. The association of other strong O VI absorbers with LLS suggests that they trace galactic and not intergalactic structures.

	Abstract = {We investigate the physical processes occurring in the multiphase gas of a damped Lyalpha absorber (DLA). We base our analysis on a high-quality Keck High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) spectrum of the QSO J1211+0422 in which a DLA is detected at z ~= 2.377. There is little contamination of the high-ion (OVI, NV, CIV, SiIV) absorption, allowing us to explore the properties of the highly ionized gas and its connection to other gas phases. The metallicity ([Z/H] = -1.41 +/- 0.08), HI column density [], full-width velocity (Deltavneut ~= 70 kms-1) and relative abundances ([Si/Fe] = +0.23 +/- 0.05 and [N/Si] = -0.88 +/- 0.07) of this DLA are not unusual. However, we derive the lowest CII* cooling rate in a DLA, lc < 10-27.8ergs-1 per H atom (3sigma). Using this stringent limit, we show that the neutral gas (confined at |v| < +39kms-1) must be warm and the star formation rate is <7.1 × 10-3Msolaryr-1kpc-2. Surprisingly, the gas shows strong, complex absorption profiles from highly ionized gas whose kinematics appear connected to each other and the low ions. The total amount of highly and weakly ionized gas is very large with >~ 1.5. At |v| >~ +39kms-1, the gas is fully and highly ionized []. Based on ionization models, OVI and NV are generally difficult to produce by hard photons, while SiIV and CIV can be photoionized to a large extent. There is, however, no evidence of OVI-bearing gas at T ~ 106 K associated with this DLA. In contrast, there is some evidence for narrow OVI, NV and CIV components (unexplained by photoionization), implying too low temperatures (T < 105 K) for simple collisional ionization models to produce their observed column densities. Stellar feedback is a possible source for producing the high ions, but we cannot rule out accretion of non-pristine material on to the protogalaxy.},

	Abstract = {We present a large number of 2.5D simulations of supernova remnants expanding into interstellar media having a range of densities, temperatures and magnetic field strengths. The simulations include equilibrium cooling and anisotropic, flux-limited thermal conduction along magnetic field lines. The volume of hot gas produced during the remnant's evolution is shown to be strongly influenced by the inclusion of thermal conduction, supporting prior results by Slavin & Cox and Tilley & Balsara. The magnetic field has also been shown to play an extremely important role in reheating the gas at later epochs when the hot gas bubble collapses on itself. Low-density, strongly magnetized runs show the greatest effect of this reheating.  The four-volumes and three-areas of gas with characteristic temperatures that cause it to emit in OVI, OVII and OVIII have also been catalogued and their dependence on interstellar parameters has been documented. The results reveal the importance of magnetic tension forces as well as the anisotropic thermal conduction along field lines for the production of these ions. Simulated luminosities and linewidths of OVI, OVII and OVIII as well as their dosages have been catalogued.  Simulated linewidths of radioactive species, 26Al and 60Fe, ejected by supernovae have also been catalogued and found to be less than 200 km s-1 for most of the remnants' evolution. These results enable us to understand why INTEGRAL has thus far been unable to detect very large linewidths for these radioactive species in certain star-forming regions.},

	Abstract = {Anisotropic thermal conduction plays an important role in various astrophysical systems. One of the most stringent tests of thermal conduction can be found in supernova remnants. In this paper we study anisotropic thermal conduction and examine the physical nature of the flux of thermal conduction in the classical and saturated limits. We also present a temporally second-order accurate implicit-explicit scheme for the time-update of thermal conduction terms within a numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) scheme. Several useful tests are presented showing that the method works well. We also present a convergence study of the hot gas produced in thermally conducting, magnetized supernova remnants and show that the resolutions used here provide reasonably accurate results.},

	Abstract = {We present FUSE and STIS E140M observations of the post-AGB star ZNG 1 in the globular cluster Messier 5 (l=3.9deg, b=+47.7deg d=7.5 kpc, z=+5.3 kpc). High-velocity absorption is seen in C IV, Si IV, O VI, and lower ionization species at LSR velocities of roughly -140 and -110 km s-1. We conclude that this gas is not circumstellar on the basis of photoionization models and path length arguments. Thus, the high-velocity gas along the ZNG 1 sight line is the first evidence that highly ionized HVCs can be found near the Galactic disk. We measure the metallicity of these HVCs to be [O/H]=+0.22+/-0.10, the highest of any known HVC. Given the clouds' metallicity and distance constraints, we conclude that these HVCs have a Galactic origin. This sight line probes gas toward the inner Galaxy, and we discuss the possibility that these HVCs may be related to a Galactic nuclear wind or Galactic fountain circulation in the inner regions of the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {We present a new analysis of the diffuse gas in the Magellanic Bridge (R.A. >~ 3h) based on HST STIS E140M and FUSE spectra of two early-type stars lying within the Bridge and a QSO behind it. We derive the column densities of the H I (from Lyalpha), N I, O I, Ar I, Si II, S II, and Fe II of the gas in the Bridge. Using the atomic species, we determine the first gas-phase metallicity of the Magellanic Bridge, [Z/H]=-1.02+/-0.07 toward one sight line and -1.7<[Z/H]<-0.9 toward the other, a factor of 2 or more smaller than the present-day SMC metallicity. Using the metallicity and N(H I), we show that the Bridge gas along our three lines of sight is ~70%-90% ionized, despite high H I columns, logN(H I)~=19.6-20.1. Possible sources for the ongoing ionization are certainly the hot stars within the Bridge, hot gas (revealed by O VI absorption), and leaking photons from the SMC and LMC. From the analysis of C II*, we deduce that the overall density of the Bridge must be low (<0.03-0.1 cm-3). We argue that our findings combined with other recent observational results should motivate new models of the evolution of the SMC-LMC-Galaxy system.

	Abstract = {The high- and intermediate-velocity interstellar clouds (HVCs/IVCs) are tracers of energetic processes in and around the Milky Way. Clouds with near-solar metallicity about 1 kpc above the disk trace the circulation of material between disk and halo (the Galactic fountain). The Magellanic Stream consists of gas tidally extracted from the SMC, tracing the dark matter potential of the Milky Way. Several other HVCs have low metallicity and appear to trace the continuing accretion of infalling intergalactic gas. These assertions are supported by the metallicities (0.1 to 1 solar) measured for about 10 clouds in the past decade. Direct measurements of distances to HVCs have remained elusive, however. In this paper we present four new distance brackets, using VLT observations of interstellar Ca II H and K absorption toward distant Galactic halo stars. We derive distance brackets of 5.0 to 11.7 kpc for the Cohen Stream (likely to be an infalling low-metallicity cloud), 9.8 to 15.1 kpc for Complex GCP (also known as the Smith Cloud or HVC 40-15+100 and with still unknown origin), 1.0 to 2.7 kpc for an IVC that appears associated with the return flow of the fountain in the Perseus arm, and 1.8 to 3.8 kpc for cloud g1, which appears to be in the outflow phase of the fountain. Our measurements further demonstrate that the Milky Way is accreting substantial amounts of gaseous material, which influences the Galaxy's current and future dynamical and chemical evolution.

	Abstract = {Based on an analysis of the interstellar highly ionized species CIV, SiIV, NV and OVI observed in the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) E140M spectra of four hot stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we find evidence for a hot LMC halo fed by energetic outflows from the LMC disc and even possibly an LMC galactic wind. Signatures for such outflows are the intermediate- and high-velocity components (vLSR >~ 100kms-1) relative to the LMC disc observed in the high- and low-ion absorption profiles. The stellar environments produce strong, narrow (T <~ 2 × 104K) components of CIV and SiIV associated with the LMC disc; in particular they are likely signatures of HII regions and expanding shells. Broad components are observed in the profiles of CIV, SiIV and OVI with their widths implying hot, collisionally ionized gas at temperatures of a few times 105K. There is a striking similarity in the OVI/CIV ratios for the broad LMC and high-velocity components, suggesting much of the material at vLSR >~ 100kms-1 is associated with the LMC. The velocity of the high-velocity component is large enough to escape altogether the LMC, polluting the intergalactic space between the LMC and the Milky Way. The observed high-ion ratios of the broad LMC and high-velocity components are consistent with those produced in conductive interfaces; such models are also favoured by the apparent kinematically coupling between the high and the weakly ionized species.

	Abstract = {We publish the Keck/HIRES and Keck/ESI spectra that we have obtained during the first 10 years of Keck observatory operations. Our full sample includes 42 HIRES spectra and 39 ESI spectra along 65 unique sight lines providing abundance measurements on ~85 DLA systems. The normalized data can be downloaded from the journal or from our supporting Web site. The database includes all of the sight lines that have been included in our papers on the chemical abundances, kinematics, and metallicities of the damped Lyalpha systems. This data has also been used to argue for variations in the fine-structure constant. We present new chemical abundance measurements for 10 damped Lyalpha systems and a summary table of high-resolution metallicity measurements (including values from the literature) for 153 damped Lyalpha systems at z>1.6. We caution, however, that this metallicity sample (and all previous ones) is biased to higher NHI values than a random sample.},

	Abstract = {We report the first determination of a distance bracket for the high-velocity cloud (HVC) complex C. Combined with previous measurements showing that this cloud has a metallicity of 0.15 times solar, these results provide ample evidence that complex C traces the continuing accretion of intergalactic gas falling onto the Milky Way. Accounting for both neutral and ionized hydrogen as well as He, the distance bracket implies a mass of (3-14)×106 Msolar, and the complex represents a mass inflow of 0.1-0.25 Msolar yr-1. We base our distance bracket on the detection of Ca II absorption in the spectrum of the blue horizontal branch (BHB) star SDSS J120404.78+623345.6, in combination with a significant nondetection toward the BHB star BS 16034-0114. These results set a strong distance bracket of 3.7-11.2 kpc on the distance to complex C. A more weakly supported lower limit of 6.7 kpc may be derived from the spectrum of the BHB star BS 16079-0017.},

	Abstract = {We report on the discovery of strongly variable Fe II and Mg  II absorption lines seen at z=1.48 in the spectra of the z=4.05 GRB 060206 obtained between 4.13 and 7.63 hr (observer frame) after the burst. In particular, the Fe II line equivalent width (EW) decayed rapidly from 1.72+/-0.25 {\AA} to 0.28+/-0.21 {\AA}, only to increase to 0.96+/-0.21 {\AA} in a later spectrum. The Mg II doublet shows even more complicated evolution: the weaker line of the doublet drops from 2.05+/-0.25 {\AA} to 0.92+/-0.32 {\AA} but then more than doubles to 2.47+/-0.41 {\AA} in later data. The ratio of the EWs for the Mg II doublet is also variable, being closer to 1:1 (saturated regime) when the lines are stronger and becoming closer to 2:1 (unsaturated regime) when the lines are weaker, consistent with expectations based on atomic physics. We have investigated and rejected the possibility of any instrumental or atmospheric effects causing the observed strong variations. Our discovery of clearly variable intervening Fe  II and Mg II lines immediately indicates that the characteristic size of intervening patches of Mg II ``clouds'' is comparable to the GRB beam size, i.e., about 1016 cm. We discuss various implications of this discovery, including the nature of the Mg II absorbers, the physics of GRBs, and measurements of chemical abundances from GRB and quasar absorption lines.

	Abstract = {We report on two z~4 gamma-ray bursts, GRB 060206 and GRB 060210, for which we have obtained well-sampled optical light curves. Both light curves show unusual behavior. GRB 060206 experienced a slow early decay, followed by a rapid increase in brightness by factor 2.5 about 1 hr after the burst. Its afterglow then faded in a broken power-law fashion, with a smooth break at tb=0.6 days, but with additional, less dramatic ``bumps and wiggles.'' The afterglow of GRB 060210 is also unusual: the light curve was more or less flat between 60 and 300 s after the burst, followed by a 70% increase at 600 s after the burst, after which the light curve declined as a ~t-1.3 power law. We argue that ``anomalous'' optical afterglows are likely to be the norm and that such rapid optical variations should be seen in many bursts, given good enough sampling. Given that, some of the usual procedures, such as deriving the jet opening angle from fitting a smooth function to the optical light curve, might often have a poor statistical significance. We propose that the rapid rise at ~3000 s in the optical for GRB 060206 and the optical bump at ~700 s in GRB 060210 might be due to the turn-on of the external shock. The existence and timing of such features could provide us with valuable additional information about the bursts.  Based on data from the MDM 2.4 m and 1.3 m telescopes.},

	Abstract = {We have identified a metal-strong [logN(Zn+)>=13.15 or logN(Si+)>=15.95] damped Lyalpha (MSDLA) population from an automated quasar (QSO) absorber search in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 3 quasar sample and find that MSDLAs comprise ~5% of the entire DLA population with zabs>=2.2 found in QSO sight lines with r<19.5. We have also acquired 27 Keck ESI (Echellete Spectrograph and Imager) follow-up spectra of metal-strong candidates in order to evaluate our automated technique and examine the MSDLA candidates at higher resolution. We demonstrate that the rest equivalent widths of strong Zn II lambda2026 and Si II lambda1808 lines in low-resolution SDSS spectra are accurate indicators of metal-strong systems in higher resolution spectra, and predict the observed equivalent widths Wobs and signal-to-noise ratios needed to detect certain extremely weak lines with high-resolution instruments. We investigate how the MSDLAs may affect previous studies concerning a dust obscuration bias and the N(H I)-weighted cosmic mean metallicity <Z(z)>. Finally, we include a brief discussion of abundance ratios in our ESI sample and find that underlying mostly Type II supernova enrichment are differential depletion effects due to dust (and in a few cases, these are quite strong); we present here a handful of new Ti and Mn measurements, both of which are useful probes of depletion in DLAs. Future papers will present detailed examinations of particularly metal-strong DLAs from high-resolution Keck I HIRES and VLT UVES spectra.},

	Abstract = {We explore the role of anisotropic thermal conduction on the evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs) through interstellar media with a range of densities via numerical simulations. We find that a remnant expanding in a dense environment can produce centre-bright hard X-ray emission within 20 kyr, and centre-bright soft X-ray emission within 60 kyr of the supernova event. In a more tenuous environment, the appearance of a centre-bright structure in hard X-rays is delayed until about 60 kyr. The soft X-ray emission from such a remnant may not become centre bright during its observable lifetime. This can explain the observations that show that mixed-morphology SNRs preferentially occur close to denser, molecular environments. Remnants expanding into denser environments tend to be smaller, making it easier for thermal conduction to make large changes in the temperatures of their hot gas bubbles. We show that the lower temperatures make it very favourable to use high-stage ions as diagnostics of the hot gas bubbles in SNRs. In particular, the distribution of OVIII transitions from shell bright at early epochs to centre bright at later epochs in the evolution of an SNR expanding in a dense interstellar medium when the physics of thermal conduction is included.},

	Abstract = {As large optical quasar surveys for DLAs become a reality and the study of star-forming gas in the early universe achieves statistical robustness, it is now vital to identify and quantify the sources of systematic error. Because the nature of optically selected quasar surveys makes them vulnerable to dust obscuration, we have undertaken a radio-selected quasar survey for DLAs to address this bias. We present the definition and results of this survey. We then combine our sample with the CORALS data set to investigate the H I column density distribution function fHI(N,X) of DLAs toward radio-selected quasars. We find that fHI(N,X) is well fitted by a power law fHI(N,X)=k1Nalpha1, with logk1=22.90 and alpha1=-2.18+0.20-0.26. This power law is in excellent agreement with that of optically selected samples at low NHI, an important yet expected result given that obscuration should have negligible effect at these gas columns. However, because of the relatively small size of the radio-selected sample, 26 DLAs in 119 quasars, fHI(N,X) is not well constrained at large NHI, and the first moment of the H I distribution function, Omegag, is, strictly speaking, a lower limit. The power law is steep enough, however, that extrapolating it to higher column densities implies only a modest, logarithmic increase in Omegag. The radio-selected value of Omegag=1.15+0.37-0.38×10-3 agrees well with the results of optically selected surveys. While our results indicate that dust obscuration is likely not a major issue for surveys of DLAs, we estimate that a radio-selected sample of ~100 DLAs will be required to obtain the precision necessary to absolutely confirm an absence of dust bias.},

	Abstract = {We describe a new method for accurately determining total gas-phase abundances for the Galactic halo interstellar medium with minimal ionization uncertainties. For sight lines toward globular clusters containing both ultraviolet-bright stars and radio pulsars, it is possible to measure column densities of H I and several ionization states of selected metals using ultraviolet absorption line measurements and of H II using radio dispersion measurements. By measuring the ionized hydrogen column, we minimize ionization uncertainties that plague abundance measurements of Galactic halo gas. We apply this method for the first time to the sight line toward the globular cluster Messier 3 [(l,b)=(42.2d,+78.7d), d=10.2 kpc, z=10.0 kpc] using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy of the post-asymptotic giant branch star von Zeipel 1128 and radio observations by Ransom et al. of recently discovered millisecond pulsars. The fraction of hydrogen associated with ionized gas along this sight line is 45%+/-5%, with the warm (T~104 K) and hot (T>~105 K) ionized phases present in roughly a 5:1 ratio. This is the highest measured fraction of ionized hydrogen along a high-latitude pulsar sight line. We derive total gas-phase abundances logN(S)/N(H)=-4.87+/-0.03 and logN(Fe)/N(H)=-5.27+/-0.05. Our derived sulfur abundance is in excellent agreement with recent solar system determinations of Asplund, Grevesse, & Sauval. However, it is -0.14 dex below the solar system abundance typically adopted in studies of the interstellar medium. The iron abundance is ~-0.7 dex below the solar system abundance, consistent with the significant incorporation of iron into interstellar grains. Abundance estimates derived by simply comparing S II and Fe II to H I are +0.17 and +0.11 dex higher, respectively, than the abundance estimates derived from our refined approach. Ionization corrections to the gas-phase abundances measured in the standard way are, therefore, significant compared with the measurement uncertainties along this sight line. The systematic uncertainties associated with the uncertain contribution to the electron column density from ionized helium could raise these abundances by <~+0.03 dex (+7%). Uncertainties in the amount of very hot gas (T~106 K) along the line of sight could also affect these determinations.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We discuss interstellar temperature determinations using the excitation equilibrium of the 2P levels of Si II and C II. We show how observations of the 2P3/2 fine-structure levels of Si II and C II (which have significantly different excitation energies, corresponding to ~413 and 92 K, respectively) can be used to limit gas kinetic temperatures. We apply this method to the z=4.224 damped Lyalpha system toward the quasar PSS 1443+27. The lack of significant absorption out of the Si II 2P3/2 level and the presence of very strong C II 2P3/2 provide an upper limit to the temperature of the C II*-bearing gas in this system. Assuming a solar Si/C ratio, the observations imply a 2 sigma limit T<954 K for this absorber; a supersolar Si/C ratio gives stricter limits, T<524 K. The observations suggest the presence of a cold neutral medium; such cold gas may serve as the fuel for star formation in this young galaxy.},

	Abstract = {Current measurements indicate that the deuterium abundance in diffuse interstellar gas varies spatially by a factor of ~4 among sight lines extending beyond the Local Bubble. One plausible explanation for the scatter is the variable depletion of D onto dust grains. To test this scenario, we have obtained high signal-to-noise, high- resolution profiles of the refractory ion Ti II along seven Galactic sight lines with D/H ranging from 0.65 to 2.1×10-5. These measurements, acquired with the recently upgraded Keck/HIRES spectrometer, indicate a correlation between Ti/H and D/H at the better than 95% confidence level Therefore, our observations support the interpretation that D/H scatter is associated with differential depletion. We note, however, that Ti/H values taken from the literature do not uniformly show the correlation. Finally, we identify significant component-to-component variations in the depletion levels among individual sight lines and discuss complications arising from this behavior.},

	Abstract = {We present Keck HIRES abundance measurements and metal-line kinematic profiles of the damped Lyalpha systems (DLAs) toward the quasars Q0933+733 (zabs=1.479) and Q0948+433 (zabs=1.233). These two DLAs have among the five highest H I column densities at any redshift: N(HI)=4.2×1021 cm-2. The metal-line data, presented here for the first time, reveal that these DLAs are noteworthy for several other reasons as well. (1) The Q0933+733 DLA exhibits a simple kinematic structure with unusually narrow velocity widths as measured from its unsaturated metal lines (Deltav=16 km s-1). At 2.6% solar, it has the second lowest metallicity at z<2. (2) The Q0948+433 DLA has among the strongest metal-line transitions of any known DLA. The saturated Si II lambda1808 line implies a high metallicity ([Si/H]>-1) and a significant alpha-enhancement. The strong metal lines of this DLA have made possible the detection of Ti II lambda1910, Co II lambda2012, and Mg I lambda2026. (3) We find that the relative gas-phase abundances of both DLAs follow the general trend seen at high redshift, e.g., enhanced Zn/Fe and Si/Fe and subsolar Mn/Fe, indicating that there is little evolution in the nucleosynthetic patterns of DLAs down to this epoch. (4) Their high H I column densities imply that these DLAs dominate the column density-weighted cosmic mean metallicity, <Z>, of the universe at z<1.5. Using the 15 DLAs with measured metallicities in the redshift interval 0.4<z<1.5, we find <Z>=-0.89+0.40-0.33, where the uncertainties are 95% confidence limits.

	Abstract = {In order to study the small-scale structure of hot interstellar gas, we obtained Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer interstellar O VI absorption spectra of four post-extreme horizontal branch stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752 ([l,b]=[336.50d,-25.63d], d=3.9 kpc, z=-1.7 kpc). The good-quality spectra of these stars allow us to measure both lines of the O VI doublet at 1031.926 and 1037.617 {\AA}. The close proximity of these stars permits us to probe the hot interstellar gas over angular scales of only 2.2m-8.9m, corresponding to spatial scales of <~2.5-10.1 pc. On these scales we detect no variations in the O VI column density and velocity distribution. The average column density is log<N(O VI)>=14.34+/-0.02 (log<N⊥(O VI)>=13.98). The measured velocity dispersions of the O VI absorption are also indistinguishable. Including the earlier results of Howk et al., this study suggests that interstellar O VI is smooth on scales Deltatheta<~12', corresponding to a spatial scale of <~10 pc, and is quite patchy at larger scales. Although such small scales are only probed in a few directions, this suggests a characteristic size scale for the regions producing collisionally ionized O VI in the Galaxy.

@article{prochaska2004,
	Abstract = {We present results from an analysis of FUSE spectroscopy of the zem=0.57 quasar PKS 0405-123. We focus on the intervening metal-line systems identified along the sight line and investigate their ionization mechanism, ionization state, and chemical abundances. Including Hubble Space Telescope STIS spectroscopy, we survey the entire sight line and identify six O VI absorbers to a 3 sigma equivalent width (EW) limit of 60 m{\AA}. This implies an incidence dN/dz=16+9-6 consistent with previous O VI studies. In half of the O VI systems we report positive detections of C III, suggesting that the gas is predominantly photoionized, has multiple ionization phases, or is in a nonequilibrium state. This contrasts with the general description of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) as described by numerical simulations in which the gas is predominantly in collisional ionization equilibrium. An appreciable fraction of O VI absorbers may therefore have a different origin. We have also searched the sight line for the Ne VIII doublet (a better probe of the WHIM at T>106 K) over the redshift range 0.2<z<zem. We report no positive detections to an EW limit of 80 m{\AA}, giving dN/dz<40 at 95% c.l. The photoionized metal-line systems exhibit a correlation between the ionization parameter (U≡Phi/cnH, with Phi the flux of hydrogen ionizing photons) and H I column density for N(HI)=1014-1016 cm-2. Both the slope and normalization of this correlation match the prediction inferred from the results of Dav{\'e} and Tripp for the low-z Lyalpha forest. In turn, the data show a tentative, unexpected result: five out of the six photoionized metal-line systems show a total hydrogen column density within a factor of 2 of 1018.7 cm-2. Finally, the median metallicity [M/H] of twelve z~0.3 absorbers with N(HI)>1014 cm-2 is [M/H]>-1.5, with large scatter. This significantly exceeds the median metallicity of C IV and O VI systems at z~3 and indicates enrichment of the intergalactic medium over the past ~10 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the heat source of the neutral gas comprising damped Lyalpha systems. Unlike the Lyalpha forest, where the extragalactic background radiation field ionizes and heats the gas, we find that grain photoelectric heating by the far-ultraviolet (FUV) background is not sufficient to balance the [C II] 158 mum cooling rate inferred from damped Lyalpha systems where CII* absorption is detected. In these systems, a local energy source is required. We show that in the case of the z=1.919 damped Lyalpha system toward Q2206-19, the local source is FUV emission from the associated galaxy found by M{\o}ller et al. (2002): the mean intensity inferred from photometry is in good agreement with the intensity Jstarsnu required to explain the cooling rate. The FUV mean intensity predicted for a cold neutral medium (CNM) model, Jstarsnu=(1.7+2.7-1.0)×10-18 ergs cm-2 s-1 Hz-1 sr-1 (95% c.l.), is the largest expected from our CII* study of 45 damped Lyalpha systems. This may explain why this is the only confirmed damped Lyalpha system yet detected in emission at z>1.9. We argue that in most damped Lyalpha systems with detected CII* absorption, Jstarsnu is between 10-19 and 10-18 ergs cm-2 s-1 Hz-1 sr-1 and heats the gas that is a CNM. By contrast, in most damped Lyalpha systems with upper limits on CII* absorption the gas is a warm neutral medium (WNM). Surprisingly, the upper limits are compatible with the same range of Jstarsnu values, suggesting that the majority of damped Lyalpha systems are heated by radiation fields generated by a limited range of star formation rates per unit area, between 10-3 and 10-2 Msolar yr-1 kpc-2. We also show that CII* absorption is unlikely to arise in gas that is ionized.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of metal-poor stars (where metal is any element more massive than helium) has enabled astronomers to probe the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. More recently, element abundances in gas inside high-redshift galaxies has been probed through the absorption lines imprinted on the spectra of background quasars, but these have typically yielded measurements of only a few elements. Furthermore, interpretation of these abundances is complicated by the fact that differential incorporation of metals into dust can produce an abundance pattern similar to that expected from nucleosynthesis by massive stars. Here we report the observation of over 25 elements in a galaxy at redshift z = 2.626. With these data, we can examine nucleosynthetic processes independent of the uncertainty arising from depletion. We find that the galaxy was enriched mainly by massive stars (M > 15 solar masses) and propose that it is the progenitor of a massive elliptical galaxy. The detailed abundance patterns suggest that boron is produced through processes that act independently of metallicity, and may require alternative mechanisms for the nucleosynthesis of germanium.},

	Abstract = {We have used the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer to search for O VI lambda1031.926 emission at four locations in the starburst superwind of M82. No O VI emission was detected at any of the four pointings, with upper limits less than or equal to the 0.3-2 keV X-ray flux. These observations limit the energy lost through radiative cooling of coronal phase (T~105.5 K) gas to roughly the same magnitude as that lost in the hot phase through X-ray emission, which has been shown to be small. The wind material retains most of its energy and should be able to escape from the gravitational potential of M82, enriching the intergalactic medium with energy and metals. The lack of coronal gas in the wind and observations of spatially correlated X-ray and Halpha emission are consistent with a scenario in which the hot wind material overruns cold clouds in the halo or with one in which the Halpha and X-ray emission arise at the interface between the hot wind and a cool shell of swept-up interstellar medium, as long as the shock velocity is <~150 km s-1. The observed limits on the O VI/Halpha and C III/Halpha flux ratios rule out shock heating as the source of the T=104 K gas unless the shock velocity is <~90 km s-1.

	Abstract = {We present Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations of high-ionization interstellar absorption toward HD 14434 (l=135.1d, b=-3.8d d~2.3 kpc), an O5.5 V star in the Perseus OB1 association. Intermediate-velocity interstellar Si IV and C IV absorption is present at VLSR=-67 km s-1, while low-ionization gas associated with the Perseus arm is detected at about -50 km s-1. Neither N V nor O VI is detected at VLSR=-67 km s-1, although Al III and Fe III, tracers of warm ionized gas, are seen. The high-ion column densities in the -67 km s-1 component are log[N(CIV)]=13.92+/-0.02 cm-2, log[N(SiIV)]=13.34+/-0.02 cm-2, log[N(NV)]<=12.65 cm-2, and log[N(OVI)]<=13.73 cm-2 (3 sigma limits). The observed C IV/Si IV ratio of 3.8+/-0.3 in this intermediate-velocity cloud (IVC) is similar to the Galactic average (4.3+/-1.9). Our analysis of the Si IV and C IV line widths yields a temperature of T~10,450+/-3400 K for this component. At this low temperature, neither Si IV nor C IV can be produced via collisions. We investigate several photoionization models to explain the intermediate-velocity Si IV and C IV absorption toward HD 14434. Photoionization models employing cooling of a hot (T~106 K) diffuse plasma as the source of ionizing radiation reproduce the observed properties of the IVC toward HD 14434 quite well. The hot plasma responsible for the ionizing radiation in these models may be attributed to hot gas contained in a supershell in or near the Perseus arm or from a more generally distributed hot ionized medium.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

	Abstract = {We present new measurements of the interstellar gas-phase oxygen abundance along the sight lines toward 19 early-type Galactic stars at an average distance of 2.6 kpc. We derive O I column densities from Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) observations of the weak 1355 {\AA} intersystem transition. We derive total hydrogen column densities [N(HI)+2N(H2)] using HST/STIS observations of Lyalpha and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations of molecular hydrogen. The molecular hydrogen content of these sight lines ranges from f(H2)=2N(H2)/[N(HI)+2N(H2)]=0.03 to 0.47. The average <Htot/EB-V> of 6.3×1021 cm-2 mag-1 with a standard deviation of 15% is consistent with previous surveys. The mean oxygen abundance along these sight lines, which probe a wide range of Galactic environments in the distant interstellar medium, is 106 (O/H)gas=408+/-13 (1 sigma in the mean). We see no evidence for decreasing gas-phase oxygen abundance with increasing molecular hydrogen fraction, and the relative constancy of (O/H)gas suggests that the component of dust containing the oxygen is not readily destroyed. We estimate that, if 60% of the dust grains are resilient against destruction by shocks, the distant interstellar total oxygen abundance can be reconciliated with the solar value derived from the most recent measurements of 106 (O/H)gassolar=517+/-58 (1 sigma). We note that the smaller oxygen abundances derived for the interstellar gas within 500 pc or from nearby B star surveys are consistent with a local elemental deficit.},

In NGC 4631, we detected O VI in emission toward a soft X-ray bubble above a region containing numerous Halpha arcs and filaments. The line-of-sight component of the motion of the O VI gas appears to match the underlying disk rotation. The observed O VI luminosities can account for 0.2%-2% of the total energy input from supernovae (assuming a full O VI- emitting halo) and yield mass flux cooling rates between 0.48 and 2.8 Msolar yr-1 depending on the model used in the derivations. On the basis of these findings, we believe it is likely that we are seeing cooling, galactic fountain gas. No emission was detected from the halo of NGC 891, a galaxy in a direction with considerably high foreground Galactic extinction.},

	Abstract = {The interstellar abundances of D I, N I, and O I in the local ISM are studied using high-resolution spectra of four hot white dwarfs. The spectra of GD 246, WD 2331-475, HZ 21, and Lan 23 were obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) in the wavelength range 905-1187 {\AA}. The line of sight to GD 246 probes the Local Interstellar Cloud and at least one other H I cloud inside the Local Bubble, which contains most of the gas seen along this line of sight. The column densities of H I, C II*, S II, and Si II are measured using archival Hubble Space Telescope STIS echelle-mode observations. The H I column density is determined by fitting the strong damping wings of interstellar Lyalpha and using a model atmosphere to account for the stellar continuum. The sight line-averaged ratios for GD 246 are DI/HI=1.51+0.39-0.33×10-5, OI/HI=3.63+0.77-0.67×10-4, and DI/OI=4.17+1.20-1.00×10-2 (uncertainties are 2 sigma). This line of sight provides the fourth reliable FUSE measurement of the Local Bubble D/H ratio. For the WD 2331-475 line of sight, we find sight line-averaged ratios DI/OI=5.13+2.20-1.69×10-2 and DI/NI=4.57+1.88-1.45×10-1. Toward HZ 21 the sight line-averaged ratios are DI/OI=4.57+2.22-1.63×10-2 and DI/NI=4.27+1.96-1.44×10-1. In the higher column density sight line to Lan 23, the sight line-averaged ratios are DI/OI=3.24+3.27-2.06×10-2 and DI/NI=3.16+1.56-1.23×10-1. Molecular hydrogen, corresponding to rotational levels J<=3, is clearly seen along this line of sight. No reliable H I measurements are available for WD 2331-475, HZ 21, or Lan 23. We combine the different abundance ratios computed here with previous published values to produce revised FUSE abundance ratios for D I/H I, O I/H I, N I/H I, D I/N I, D I/O I, and O I/N I.  Based on observations made with the NASA-CNES-CSA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), which is operated for NASA by Johns Hopkins University under NASA contract NAS 5-32985.},

	Abstract = {N66/NGC 346 is the largest and brightest H II region in the Small Magellanic Cloud and contains at least one known supernova remnant, SNR 0057-7226. Optical emission from the remnant is overwhelmed by the bright photoionized emission from the nebula, but the remnant has been detected by way of far-ultraviolet absorption (FUV) lines. Here we present data from the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite showing strong O VI and C III emission from a position at the edge of SNR 0057-7226. We also present high-resolution, long-slit Halpha spectra across N66, showing high- and low-velocity emission corresponding closely to the X-ray boundaries of the supernova remnant. We use these FUV and optical data to determine the physical parameters of the shock and interaction geometry with N66. We find that ionizing photons from the many massive cluster stars nearby likely affect the ionization balance in the postshock gas, hindering the production of lower ionization and neutral species. We discuss the importance and inherent difficulty of searching for supernova remnants in or near bright H II regions and suggest that the far ultraviolet provides a viable means to discover and study such remnants.},

	Abstract = {Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spectra of 22 Galactic halo stars are studied to determine the amount of O VI in the Galactic halo between ~0.3 and ~10 kpc from the Galactic midplane. Strong O VI lambda1031.93 absorption was detected toward 21 stars, and a reliable 3 sigma upper limit was obtained toward HD 97991. The weaker member of the O VI doublet at 1037.62 {\AA} could be studied toward only six stars because of stellar and interstellar blending problems. The measured logarithmic total column densities vary from 13.65 to 14.57 with <logN>=14.17+/-0.28 (1 sigma). The observed columns are reasonably consistent with a patchy exponential O VI distribution with a midplane density of 1.7×10-8 cm-3 and scale height between 2.3 and 4 kpc. We do not see clear signs of strong high-velocity components in O VI absorption along the Galactic sight lines, which indicates the general absence of high-velocity O VI within 2-5 kpc of the Galactic midplane. This result is in marked contrast to the findings of Sembach et al., who reported high-velocity O VI absorption toward ~60% of the complete halo sight lines observed by FUSE. The line centroid velocities of the O VI absorption do not reflect Galactic rotation well. The O VI velocity dispersions range from 33 to 78 km s-1, with an average of <b>=45+/-11 km s-1 (1 sigma). These values are much higher than the value of ~18 km s-1 expected from thermal broadening for gas at T~3×105 K, the temperature at which O VI is expected to reach its peak abundance in collisional ionization equilibrium. Turbulence, inflow, and outflow must have an effect on the shape of the O VI profiles. Kinematical comparisons of O VI with Ar I reveal that eight of 21 sight lines are closely aligned in LSR velocity (|DeltaVLSR|<=5 km s-1), while nine of 21 exhibit significant velocity differences (|DeltaVLSR|>=15 km s-1). This dual behavior may indicate the presence of two different types of O VI-bearing environments toward the Galactic sight lines. The correlation between the H I and O VI intermediate-velocity absorption is poor. We could identify the known H I intermediate-velocity components in the Ar I absorption but not in the O VI absorption in most cases. Comparison of O VI with other highly ionized species suggests that the high ions are produced primarily by cooling hot gas in the Galactic fountain flow and that turbulent mixing also has a significant contribution. The role of turbulent mixing varies from negligible to dominant. It is most important toward sight lines that sample supernova remnants like Loops I and IV. The average N(C IV)/N(O VI) ratios for the nearby halo (this work) and complete halo (Savage et al.) are similar (~0.6), but the dispersion is larger in the sample of nearby halo sight lines. We are able to show that the O VI enhancement toward the Galactic center region that was observed in the FUSE survey of complete halo sight lines (Savage et al.) is likely associated with processes occurring near the Galactic center by comparing the observations toward the nearby HD 177566 sight line to those toward extragalactic targets.},

	Abstract = {We present Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations of the post-asymptotic giant branch star von Zeipel 1128 (l=42.5d, b=+78.7d d=10.2 kpc; z=10.0 kpc vLSR=-140+/-8 km s-1), located in the globular cluster Messier 3. The FUSE observations cover the wavelength range 905-1187 {\AA} at ~20 km s-1 (FWHM) resolution. These data exhibit many photospheric and interstellar absorption lines, including absorption from ions associated with the warm neutral, warm ionized, and highly ionized phases of the interstellar medium along this sight line. We derive interstellar column densities of H I, P II, Ar I, Fe II, Fe III, S III, and O VI, with lower limits for C II, C III, N I, O I, and Si II. Though the individual velocity components within the absorption profiles are unresolved by FUSE, a comparison of the velocity distribution of depleted or ionized species with the neutral species suggests that the thick-disk material along this sight line is infalling onto the Galactic plane, while material near the plane is seen closer to rest velocities. Ionized hydrogen represents >~12%, most likely ~45%, of the total hydrogen column along this sight line, most of it associated with the warm ionized phase. The warm ionized and neutral media toward von Zeipel 1128 have very similar gas-phase abundances and kinematics: the neutral and ionized gases in this region of the thick disk are closely related. Strong O VI absorption is seen with the same central velocity as the warm ionized gas, although the O VI velocity dispersion is much higher (sigma≡sqrt(2)b=32 km s-1). Virtually all of the O VI is found at velocities where lower ionization gas is seen, suggesting that the O VI and WNM/WIM probes are tracing different portions of the same structures (e.g., the O VI may reside in interfaces surrounding the WNM/WIM clouds). We see no evidence for interstellar absorption associated with the globular cluster Messier 3 itself or with the circumstellar environment of von Zeipel 1128. Neither high-velocity cloud absorption (with |vLSR|>~125 km s-1) nor high velocity dispersion gas (with sigma~60 km s-1) is seen toward von Zeipel 1128.},

	Abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations of high ion interstellar ultraviolet absorption along the sight line to HD 116852. At a distance of 4.8 kpc, HD 116852 is an O9 III star lying in the low Galactic halo, -1.3 kpc from the plane of the Galaxy in the direction l=304.9d, b=-16.1d. The sight line passes underneath the Sagittarius-Carina and the Norma-Centaurus spiral arms. The STIS E140H grating observations provide high-resolution (FWHM~2.7kms-1) spectra of the resonance doublets of Si IV, C IV, and N V. These data are complemented by medium-resolution (FWHM~20kms-1) FUSE spectra of O VI. The integrated logarithmic column densities are logN(Si IV)=13.60+/-0.02, logN(C IV)=14.08+/-0.03, logN(N V)=13.34+0.05-0.06, and logN(O VI)=14.28+/-0.01. We find evidence for three distinct types of highly ionized gas present in the data. First, two narrow absorption components are resolved in the Si IV and C IV profiles, at approximate LSR velocities of -36 and -10 km s-1 . These narrow components appear to be produced in gas associated with the Norma and Sagittarius spiral arms, at approximate z-distances of -1.0 and -0.5 kpc, respectively. The temperature of the gas in these narrow components, as implied by their b-values, suggests that the gas is photoionized. The ratio of C IV to Si IV in these narrow components is low compared to the Galactic average. Second, we detect an intermediate-width component in C IV and Si IV, at 17 km s-1, which we propose could arise at the conductive interface at the boundary between a low column density neutral or weakly ionized cloud and the surrounding hot medium. Finally, a broad collisionally ionized component of gas responsible for producing the smooth N V and O VI profiles is observed; such absorption is also present to a lesser degree in the profiles of Si IV and C IV. The broad O VI absorption is observed at a velocity displaced from the broad C IV component by almost 20 km s-1, an amount large enough to suggest that the two ions may not coexist in the same physical location. If these two ions do exist together, then the ratio N(C IV)/N(O VI) is too low to be consistent with turbulent mixing layer models, but could be explained by radiative cooling or conductive heating models. Combining our results with high resolution observations of four other sight lines from the literature, we find an average C IV component frequency of 1.0+/-0.25kpc-1.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution spectra of the hot white dwarf G191-B2B, covering the wavelength region 905-1187 {\AA}, were obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). These data were used in conjunction with existing high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) observations to evaluate the total H I, D I, O I, and N I column densities along the line of sight. Previous determinations of N(D I) based upon GHRS and STIS observations were controversial as a result of the saturated strength of the D I Lyalpha line. In the present analysis the column density of D I has been measured using only the unsaturated Lybeta and Lygamma lines observed by FUSE. A careful inspection of possible systematic uncertainties tied to the modeling of the stellar continuum or to the uncertainties in the FUSE instrumental characteristics has been performed. The column densities derived are logN(DI)=13.40+/-0.07, logN(OI)=14.86+/-0.07, and logN(NI)=13.87+/-0.07, quoted with 2 sigma uncertainties. The measurement of the H I column density by profile fitting of the Lyalpha line has been found to be uncertain. If additional weak, hot interstellar components are added to the three detected clouds along the line of sight, the H I column density can be reduced quite significantly, even though the signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution at Lyalpha are excellent. The new estimate of N(H I) toward G191-B2B reads logN(HI)=18.18+/-0.18 (2 sigma), so that the average D/H ratio on the line of sight is D/H=(1.66+0.9-0.6)×10-5 (2 sigma). This work is based on data obtained for the Guaranteed Time Team by the NASA-CNES-CSA FUSE mission operated by Johns Hopkins University.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution far-UV spectra of the O-type subdwarf BD +28$\,^{\circ}$4211 were obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) to measure the interstellar deuterium, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances in this direction. The interstellar D I transitions are analyzed down to Lyiota at 920.7 {\AA}. The star was observed several times at different target offsets in the direction of spectral dispersion. The aligned and co-added spectra have high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N=50-100). D I, N I, and O I transitions were analyzed with curve-of-growth and profile fitting techniques. A model of interstellar molecular hydrogen on the line of sight was derived from H2 lines in the FUSE spectra and used to help analyze some features where blending with H2 was significant. The H I column density was determined from high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph spectra of Lyalpha to be logN(HI)=19.846+/-0.035 (2 sigma), which is higher than is typical for sight lines in the local interstellar medium (ISM) studied for D/H. We found that D/H=(1.39+/-0.21)×10-5 (2 sigma) and O/H=(2.37+/-0.55)×10-4 (2 sigma). O/H toward BD +28$\,^{\circ}$4211 appears to be significantly below the mean O/H ratio for the ISM and the Local Bubble.

	Abstract = {We present measurements of the column densities of interstellar D I and O I made with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and of H I made with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) toward the sdOB star Feige 110 [(l,b)=(74.09d,-59.07d) d=179+265-67 pc; z=-154+57-227 pc]. Our determination of the D I column density made use of curve-of-growth fitting and profile fitting analyses, while our O I column density determination used only curve-of-growth techniques. The H I column density was estimated by fitting the damping wings of the interstellar Lyalpha profile. We find logN(DI)=15.47+/-0.06, logN(OI)=16.73+/-0.10, and logN(HI)=20.14+0.13-0.20 (all errors 2 sigma). This implies D/H=(2.14+/-0.82)×10-5, D/O=(5.50+1.64-1.33)×10-2, and O/H=(3.89+/-1.67)×10-4. Taken with the FUSE results reported in companion papers and previous measurements of the local interstellar medium (LISM), this suggests the possibility of spatial variability in D/H for sight lines exceeding ~100 pc. This result may constrain models which characterize the mixing timescales and length scales of material in the LISM.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of interstellar absorption along the line of sight to the nearby white dwarf star HZ 43A. The distance to this star is 68+/-13 pc, and the line of sight extends toward the north Galactic pole. Column densities of O I, N I, and N II were derived from spectra obtained by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), the column density of D I was derived from a combination of our FUSE spectra and an archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) GHRS spectrum, and the column density of H I was derived from a combination of the GHRS spectrum and values derived from Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) data obtained from the literature. We find the following abundance ratios (with 2 sigma uncertainties): DI/HI=(1.66+/-0.28)×10-5, OI/HI=(3.63+/-0.84)×10-4, and NI/HI=(3.80+/-0.74)×10-5. The N II column density was slightly greater than that of N I, indicating that ionization corrections are important when deriving nitrogen abundances. Other interstellar species detected along the line of sight were C II, C III, O VI, Si II, Ar I, Mg II, and Fe II; an upper limit was determined for N III. No elements other than H I were detected in the stellar photosphere.

	Abstract = {Observations obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) have been used to determine the column densities of D I, N I, and O I along seven sight lines that probe the local interstellar medium (LISM) at distances from 37 to 179 pc. Five of the sight lines are within the Local Bubble, and two penetrate the surrounding H I wall. Reliable values of N(H I) were determined for five of the sight lines from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) data, and published Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) measurements. The weighted mean of D I/H I for these five sight lines is (1.52+/-0.08)×10-5 (1 sigma uncertainty in the mean). It is likely that the D I/H I ratio in the Local Bubble has a single value. The D I/O I ratio for the five sight lines within the Local Bubble is (3.76+/-0.20)×10-2. It is likely that O I column densities can serve as a proxy for H I in the Local Bubble. The weighted mean for O I/H I for the seven FUSE sight lines is (3.03+/-0.21)×10-4, comparable to the weighted mean (3.43+/-0.15)×10-4 reported for 13 sight lines probing larger distances and higher column densities. The FUSE weighted mean of N I/H I for five sight lines is half that reported by Meyer and colleagues for seven sight lines with larger distances and higher column densities. This result combined with the variability of O I/N I (six sight lines) indicates that at the low column densities found in the LISM, nitrogen ionization balance is important. Thus, unlike O I, N I cannot be used as a proxy for H I or as a metallicity indicator in the LISM.},

	Abstract = {We present an atlas of 57 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 37 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) observations obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite. The atlas highlights 12 interstellar absorption-line transitions at a resolution of ~15 km s-1. These transitions cover a broad range of temperatures, ionization states, and abundances. The species included are O VI, which probes hot (T~3×105 K) ionized gas; C III and Fe III, which probe warm (T~104 K) ionized gas; Si II, P II, C II, Fe II, and O I, which probe warm neutral gas; and six different molecular hydrogen transitions, which trace cold (T<=500 K) gas. We include Schmidt Halpha CCD images of the region surrounding each sight line showing the morphology of warm ionized gas in the vicinity, along with continuum images near each FUSE aperture position. We present several initial scientific results derived from this dataset on the interstellar medium of the Magellanic Clouds and Galactic halo. O VI absorption at Magellanic Cloud velocities appears along nearly all sight lines, regardless of optical emission-line morphology. The velocity field of LMC disk material is probed using P II lambda1152.8 absorption and is seen to be consistent with recent H I results. While the velocity structure of the SMC is complex, two absorption features are clearly separated in the SMC data-a strong absorption complex between +100 and +130 km s-1, and a weaker feature near +180 km s-1. The velocity separation between these complexes varies with position, being greater on average in the southwest portion of the SMC. A lower velocity absorption component seen the nine sight lines toward the bright H II region N66 in the SMC may be the result of an outflow or an old SNR within this nebular complex. Absorption in Fe II and O I at ~+60 km s-1 and ~+120 km s-1 appear along many LMC sight lines. They are attributed, respectively, to an intermediate-velocity cloud and a high-velocity cloud in the Milky Way halo. Both features are dramatically stronger toward the eastern half of the LMC and are not correlated with each other or with LMC Halpha morphology. The lower velocity of the SMC and broader absorption lines complicate the detection of intermediate and high velocity Galactic absorption along SMC sight lines.

	Abstract = {We report Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations of interstellar O VI absorption in the halo of the Milky Way toward 12 early-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 11 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The mean column densities of O VI associated with the Galactic halo toward the LMC and SMC are log<N(OVI)>=14.52+0.10-0.14 and 14.13+0.14-0.20, respectively, where the uncertainties represent the standard deviations of the individual measurements about the means. Significant variations in the O VI column densities are observed over all of the angular scales probed by our observations: 0.5d-5.0d toward the LMC and 0.05d-3.3d toward the SMC. The maximum factors by which the O VI varies between sight lines toward the LMC and SMC are ~2.8 and ~4.2, respectively. Although low-, intermediate-, and high-velocity clouds are present along most of the sight lines toward the LMC, the variations in O VI column densities are found in all of these O VI absorbing structures. The column density variations trace the structure of the hot ionized medium in the Galactic halo on scales of <<80-800 pc toward the LMC and <<6-400 pc toward the SMC (assuming that the absorption arises within the first 5 kpc above the Galactic plane).},

	Abstract = {We investigate the ionization state of the damped Lyalpha system at z=2.62 toward GB 1759+7539 through an analysis of ionic ratios sensitive to photoionization: Ar0/S+, Fe++/Fe+, N+/N0, and Al++/Al+. Approximately half of the metals arise in a mostly neutral velocity component with H I/H>0.9, based on Fe++/Fe+<0.013. In contrast, the remaining half exhibit Fe++/Fe+~0.3, indicative of a partially ionized medium with H I/H~0.5. These conclusions are supported by the observed N+/N0, Al++/Al+, and Ar0/Si+ ratios. We assess ionization corrections for the observed column densities through photoionization models derived from the CLOUDY software package. In the neutral gas, the ionization corrections are negligible, except for Ar0. However, for the partially ionized gas, element abundance ratios differ from the ionic ratios by 0.1-0.3 dex for (Si+, S+, Ni+, Al+)/Fe+ ratios and more for (N0, Ar0)/Fe+. Independent of the shape of the photoionizing spectrum and assumptions of the number of ionization phases, these ionization corrections have minimal impact (<~0.1 dex) on the total metallicity inferred for this damped Lyalpha system. Measurements of the relative elemental abundances of the partially ionized gas, however, have a greater than ~0.15 dex uncertainty, which hides the effects of nucleosynthesis and differential dust depletion. We caution the reader that this damped system is unusual for a number of reasons (e.g., a very low Ar0/S+ ratio), and we believe its ionization properties are special but not unique. Nevertheless, it clearly shows the value of examining photoionization diagnostics such as Fe++/Fe+ in a larger sample of damped systems. Visiting Astronomer, W. M. Keck Telescope.

	Abstract = {We present the results of a Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) survey of O VI lambda1031.93 and lambda1037.62 absorption toward 18 OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The FUSE data are of very high quality, allowing a detailed study of the coronal temperature gas in the SMC. We find that O VI is ubiquitous in the SMC, with a detection along every sight line. The average value of the O VI column density in the SMC is log<N(OVI)>=14.53. This value is 1.7 times higher than the average value for the Milky Way halo (perpendicular to the Galactic plane) of logN⊥(OVI)=14.29 found by FUSE, even though the SMC has much lower metallicity than the Galaxy. The column density in the SMC is higher along sight lines that lie close to star-forming regions, in particular NGC 346 in the northern part of the SMC, and to a lesser degree the southwestern complex of H II regions. This correlation with star formation suggests that local processes have an important effect on the distribution of coronal gas in the SMC. If the sight lines within NGC 346 are excluded, the mean column density for the SMC is logN(OVI)=14.45, only 1.4 times higher than the Milky Way average. The standard deviation of the column densities for sight lines outside of NGC 346 is +/-27%, somewhat lower than the deviation seen in the Milky Way halo. The lowest O VI column densities, log N(O VI)~14.3, occur in the central region and in the southeastern ``wing'' of the galaxy. Even these low column densities are as high as the Milky Way average, establishing the presence of a substantial, extended component of coronal gas in the SMC. The O VI absorption is always shifted to higher velocities than the main component of lower ionization gas traced by Fe II absorption. The O VI line widths are broader than expected for pure thermal broadening at 3×105 K, the temperature at which the O VI peaks in abundance, so large nonthermal motions or multiple hot gas components are likely present. We discuss several mechanisms that may be able to explain the observed properties of the hot gas, including supershells, a galactic fountain, and the infall of gas previously stripped from the SMC by tidal interactions with the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud. If a galactic fountain produces the hot gas, the mass flux per unit surface area is M/Omega~2×10-2 Msolar yr-1 kpc-2.},

	Abstract = {We present Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations of interstellar O VI absorption toward 12 early-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The observations have a velocity resolution of <~20 km s-1 (FWHM) and clearly show O VI 1031.926 {\AA} absorption at LMC velocities toward all 12 stars. From these observations we derive column densities of interstellar O VI in this nearby galaxy; the observed columns are in the range logN(OVI)=13.9-14.6, with a mean of 14.37 and a standard deviation of +/-38% (+0.14-0.21 dex). The observations probe several sight lines projected onto known superbubbles in the LMC, but these show relatively little (if any) enhancement in O VI column density compared to sight lines toward relatively quiescent regions of the LMC. The observed LMC O VI absorption is broad, with Gaussian dispersions sigma~30-50 km s-1. This implies temperatures T<~(2-5)×106, indicating that much of the broadening is nonthermal because O VI has a very low abundance at such high temperatures. The O VI absorption is typically displaced ~-30 km s-1 from the corresponding low-ionization absorption associated with the bulk of the LMC gas. The general properties of the LMC O VI absorption are very similar to those of the Milky Way halo. The average column density of O VI and the dispersion of the individual measurements about the mean are identical to those measured for the halo of the Milky Way, even though the metallicity of the LMC is a factor of ~2.5 lower than the Milky Way. The velocity dispersion measured for the LMC material is also consistent with recent measurements of the Galactic halo. The striking similarities in these quantities suggest that much of the LMC O VI may arise in a vertically extended distribution similar to the Galactic halo. We discuss the measurements in the context of a halo composed of radiatively cooling hot gas and/or turbulent mixing layers. If the observed O VI absorption is tracing a radiatively cooling galactic fountain flow, the mass flow rate from one side of the LMC disk is of the order M~1 Msolar yr-1, with a mass flux per unit area of the disk M/Omega~2×10-2 Msolar yr-1 kpc-2.},

The value of 108 yr quoted in the abstract should now be considered a lower limit. Our conclusion that the H2 that formed in the Small Magellanic Cloud survived tidal stripping is strengthened by this revision, since the in situ formation time derived in equation (3) is an order of magnitude longer than previously estimated and is comparable to the age of the Magellanic Stream.},

	Abstract = {Interstellar C IV absorption-line studies of the hot gaseous halo of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have been hindered by nonideal selections of early-type probe stars in regions where C+3 can be produced locally via photoionization, fast stellar winds, or supernovae. To observe stars outside such regions, precise spectral classifications of OB stars in the field are needed. Therefore, we have obtained medium-dispersion spectra of 42 early-type stars in the LMC that are distributed outside superbubbles or supergiant shells. The spectral classification of these stars is presented in this paper. Nineteen of these program stars have spectral types between B1 and O7 and are thus suitable probes for interstellar C IV absorption-line studies of the hot gaseous halo of the LMC.},

	Abstract = {We present Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer observations of the molecular, neutral atomic, weakly ionized, and highly ionized components of the interstellar and intergalactic material toward the quasar 3C 273. We identify Lybeta absorption in eight of the known intergalactic Lyalpha absorbers along the sight line with rest-frame equivalent widths Wr(Lyalpha)>~50 m{\AA}. Refined estimates of the H I column densities and Doppler parameters (b) of the clouds are presented. We find a range of b~16-46 km s-1. We detect multiple H I lines (Lybeta-Lytheta) in the 1590 km s-1 Virgo absorber and estimate logN(H I)=15.85+/-0.100.08, which is 10 times more H I than in all of the other absorbers along the sight line combined. The Doppler width of this absorber, b~16 km s-1, implies T<~15,000 K. We detect O VI absorption at 1015 km s-1 at the 2-3 sigma level that may be associated with hot, X-ray-emitting gas in the Virgo Cluster. We detect weak C III and O VI absorption in the intergalactic medium at z=0.12007; this absorber is predominantly ionized and has N(H+)/N(H I)>=4000Z-1, where Z is the metallicity. Strong Galactic interstellar O VI is present between -100 and 100 km s-1, with an additional high-velocity wing containing about 13% of the total O VI between ~100 and ~240 km s-1. The Galactic O VI, N V, and C IV lines have similar shapes, with roughly constant ratios across the -100 to 100 km s-1 velocity range. The high-velocity O VI wing is not detected in other species. Much of the interstellar high ion absorption probably occurs within a highly fragmented medium within the Loop IV remnant or in the outer cavity walls of the remnant. Multiple hot gas production mechanisms are required. The broad O VI absorption wing likely traces the expulsion of hot gas out of the Galactic disk into the halo. A flux limit of 5.4×10-16 ergs cm-2 s-1 on the amount of diffuse O VI emission present ~3.5' off the 3C 273 sight line combined with the observed O VI column density toward 3C 273, logN(O VI)=14.73+/-0.04, implies ne<~0.02 cm-3 and p/k<~11,500 cm-3 K for an assumed temperature of 3×105 K. The elemental abundances in the neutral and weakly ionized interstellar clouds are similar to those found for other halo clouds. The warm neutral and warm ionized clouds along the sight line have similar dust-phase abundances, implying that the properties of the dust grains in the two types of clouds are similar. Interstellar H2 absorption is present at ~16 km s-1 at a level of logN(H2)~15.71 but does not trace the main column density concentration along the sight line observed in H I 21 cm emission.},

	Abstract = {We report the first Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer measurements of diffuse O VI (lambdalambda1032, 1038) emission from the general diffuse interstellar medium outside of supernova remnants or superbubbles. We observed a 30''×30'' region of the sky centered at l=315.0d and b=-41.3d. From the observed intensities (2930+/-290 [random]+/-410 [systematic] and 1790+/-260 [random]+/-250 [systematic] photons cm-2 s-1 sr-1 in lambdalambda1032 and 1038, respectively), derived equations, and assumptions about the source location, we calculate the intrinsic intensity, electron density, thermal pressure, and emitting depth. The intensities are too large for the emission to originate solely in the Local Bubble. Thus, we conclude that the Galactic thick disk and lower halo also contribute. High-velocity clouds are ruled out because there are none near the pointing direction. The calculated emitting depth is small, indicating that the O VI-bearing gas fills a small volume. The observations can also be used to estimate the cooling rate of the hot interstellar medium and to constrain models. The data also yield the first intensity measurement of the C II 3s 2S1/2-2p 2P3/2 emission line at 1037 {\AA} and place upper limits on the intensities of ultraviolet line emission from C I, C III, Si II, S III, S IV, S VI, and Fe III.},

	Abstract = {We report a detection of far-ultraviolet absorption from the supernova remnant SNR 0057-7226 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The absorption is seen in the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spectrum of the luminous blue variable/Wolf-Rayet star HD 5980. Absorption from O VI lambda1032 and C III lambda977 is seen at a velocity of 300 km s-1 with respect to the Galactic absorption lines, 170 km s-1 with respect to the SMC absorption. The O VI lambda1038 line is contaminated by H2 absorption but is present. These lines are not seen in the FUSE spectrum of Sk 80, only ~1' (~17 pc) away from HD 5980. No blueshifted O VI lambda1032 absorption from the SNR is seen in the FUSE spectrum. The O VI lambda1032 line in the SNR is well described by a Gaussian with FWHM=75 km s-1. We find logN(O VI)=14.33-14.43, which is roughly 50% of the rest of the O VI column in the SMC (excluding the SNR) and greater than the O VI column in the Milky Way halo along this sight line. The N(C IV)/N(O VI) ratio for the SNR absorption is in the range of 0.12-0.17, similar to the value seen in the Milky Way disk and lower than the halo value, supporting models in which SNRs produce the highly ionized gas close to the plane of the Galaxy, while other mechanisms occur in the halo. The N(C IV)/N(O VI) ratio is also lower than the SMC ratio along this sight line, suggesting that other mechanisms contribute to the creation of the global hot ionized medium in the SMC. The O VI, C IV, and Si IV apparent column density profiles suggest the presence of a multiphase shell followed by a region of higher temperature gas.},

	Abstract = {We analyze extant data of Al+2, Al+, and other low ions with the aim of studying the ionization properties of damped Lyalpha systems (DLAs) from the analysis of the ratio R(Al+2/Al+)≡N(Al+2)/N(Al+). We find the good correlations logN(Al+)-logN(Si+) and logN(Al+)-logN(Fe+) that we use to indirectly estimate N(Al+) from N(Si+) and/or N(Fe+) measurements. In this way, we determine the ratio R(Al+2/Al+) for a sample of 20 DLAs. Contrary to common belief, the ratio can attain relatively high values (up to 0.6), suggesting that the gas of the intermediate ionization state plays an important role in DLAs. On the other hand, the lack of any trend between abundance ratios, such as Si/H and Si/Fe and R(Al+2/Al+) indicates that abundances are not severely influenced by ionization effects. We find a logR(Al+2/Al+)-logN(H0) anticorrelation that we use in conjunction with idealized photoionization equilibrium calculations to constrain the ionization properties and to predict ionization corrections in DLAs. We consider two possible origins for the species of the low- and intermediate-ionization state: (1) neutral regions devoid of Al+2 and/or (2) partially ionized, Al+2-bearing regions. The logR(Al+2/Al+)-logN(H0) anticorrelation can be naturally explained in terms of a two-region model with a soft, stellar-type ionizing radiation field. We present abundance ionization corrections for 14 elements of astrophysical interest derived with different types of ionizing spectra. For most of these elements, the corrections are generally below measurements errors, which is contrary to the predictions of recent models presented in the literature. We briefly discuss the potential effects of inaccuracies in the Al recombination rates used in the photoionization calculations.},

	Abstract = {We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) observations of interstellar UV absorption toward HD 177989, a B0 III star at 4.9 kpc in the direction l=17.8d, b=-11.9d. The line of sight passes through the high-latitude ejecta of the Scutum supershell (GS 018-06+44), which is ~5$\,^{\circ}$ in diameter extending ~7$\,^{\circ}$ below the Galactic plane at a kinematic distance of ~3.5 kpc in the Scutum spiral arm. The observations with the STIS E140H and GHRS echelle B gratings provide far- and middle-UV spectra at resolutions (FWHM) of ~3 km s-1 and a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of ~20:1 to 50:1. The observations reveal strong and broad absorption in the lines of Si IV and C IV centered on LSR velocities of +18 and +42 km s-1 and weaker absorption from these ions near -50 and -13 km s-1. Weak absorption by N V extends over the full velocity range traced by Si IV and C IV. The +18 km s-1 high-ionization absorption likely occurs in gas ~400 pc below the Sagittarius spiral arm, while the extremely strong +42 km s-1 absorption occurs in highly ionized gas in the Scutum supershell at a distance of ~700 pc below the Galactic plane. The properties of the highly ionized gas associated with the Scutum supershell are similar to the gas found in radio loops I and IV; in both cases there is a strong enhancement in the column density of C IV without a corresponding increase in the column density of N V, which causes N(C IV)/N(N V) to be among the largest measured in the interstellar medium. The low-ionization absorption lines of N I, S II, Si II, and Fe II produce narrow absorption features at +37, +40 km s-1 and +55, +60 km s-1. The strength and kinematic properties of these absorption features bear no resemblance to those expected for the high-latitude neutral cloud seen in the H I 21 cm line. This may be due to the relatively low angular resolution (FWHM ~21') of the 21 cm observations. The kinematic relationships among the high-ionization and low-ionization absorption lines observed in the UV suggest a related origin in a hot-warm gas interface region. We are possibly seeing the warm gas in the swept-up shell surrounding a region where hot gas is being vented into the halo. In the warm gas, N(N I)/N(S II) ~0.01 solar, which implies a similar value for N(H0)/[N(H0)+N(H+)]. The warm neutral and ionized gas in the matter overlying the Scutum supershell has values of Si /S and Fe /S roughly similar to those found in the warm neutral medium of the Galactic disk in the vicinity of the Sun. While there has been grain processing in the ejecta of the Scutum supershell, the processing has not been complete. Based on observations of interstellar C IV and Si IV at high S/N and high resolution toward four very distant stars, we determine that highly ionized gas absorption components occur at a frequency of ~1 component kpc-1. The strongest components are associated with lines of sight that pass over or under spiral arms or that pass though Galactic supershells. Based on observations obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph on the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We present Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer observations of the atomic and molecular absorption in high-velocity cloud HVC 287.5+22.5+240, which lies in front of the ultraviolet-bright nucleus of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783. We detect H2, N I, N II, Si II, and Fe II and set limits on the amount of absorption due to P III, Ar I, and Fe III. We extend the earlier metallicity and dust-depletion measurements made by Lu and collaborators by examining the relative gas-phase abundances of Si, P, S, and Fe. Corrections to the derived gas-phase abundances due to ionized gas in the HVC are small (<~15%). The HVC has metallicity 0.2-0.4 solar, similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The relative abundance pattern for the elements studied resembles that of warm gas in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which supports the idea that this HVC is part of the tidally stripped leading arm of the Magellanic Stream. The abundance pattern implies that the HVC contains dust grains that have been processed significantly; it is likely that the grain mantles have been modified or stripped back to expose the grain cores. We have identified more than 30 lines of H2 arising in the HVC from rotational levels J=0 to J=3. Synthetic spectra and a curve of growth fitted to these lines with b=12 km s-1 indicate that log[N(H2)]=16.80+/-0.10 and fH2=2N(H2)/[N(H I)+2N(H2)]=1.6×10-3. A two-component temperature distribution is necessary to explain the observed populations of the H2 rotational levels. We find T01=133+37-21 K, and T23=241+20-17 K, indicating that the conditions in the molecular gas are more similar to those found for diffuse molecular clouds in the Galactic halo than to those for molecular clouds in the Galactic disk. From an analysis of the J=2 and J=3 populations, we find an absorption rate (at 1000 {\AA}) of betauv<0.1 times the average value in the solar neighborhood. The presence of molecular gas in the HVC requires that either the H2 formed in situ or that molecules formed within the SMC survived tidal stripping. We favor the latter possibility because of the long H2 formation time (~108 yr) derived for this HVC.},

	Abstract = {We report empirical determinations of atomic oscillator strengths, or f-values, for 11 ground-state transitions of Fe II in the wavelength range 1050<~lambda<~1150 {\AA}. We use ultraviolet absorption-line observations of interstellar material toward stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds taken with Copernicus, the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. We derive absolute oscillator strengths by a combination of the apparent optical depth, component-fitting, and curve-of-growth fitting techniques. Our derived oscillator strengths are generally in excellent agreement with recent theoretical calculations by Raassen & Uylings using the orthogonal operator technique. However, we identify three of the 11 transitions studied here whose f-values seem to be incompatible with these calculations by as much as a factor of 2. We suggest revisions to these f-values based on our analysis.

	Abstract = {We use new Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and archival Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) observations to study interstellar B II lambda1362 and O I lambda1355 absorption along seven sight lines. Our new column density measurements, combined with measurements of four sight lines from the literature, allow us to study the relative B/O abundances over a wide range of interstellar environments. We measure sight-line-integrated relative gas-phase abundances in the range [B/O]=-1.00 to -0.17, and our data show that the B/O abundances are anticorrelated with average sight line densities over the range log<nH>~-1.3 to +0.7. Detailed comparisons of the B II and O I line shapes show that the B/O ratio is significantly higher in warm interstellar clouds than in cool clouds. These results are consistent with the incorporation of boron into dust grains in the diffuse ISM. Since boron is likely incorporated into grains, we derive a lower limit to the present-day total (gas+dust) interstellar boron abundance of B/H>~(2.5+/-0.9)×10-10. The effects of dust depletion and ionization differences from element to element will make it very difficult to reliably determine 11B/10B along most interstellar sight lines.

	Abstract = {The metal-deficient starburst galaxy I Zw 18 has been observed with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) in a search for H2 molecules. The spectrum obtained with an aperture covering the full galaxy shows no absorption lines of diffuse H2 at the radial velocity of the galaxy. The upper limit for the diffuse H2 column density is found to be very low, N(H2)<~1015 cm-2 (10 sigma), unlike our Galaxy where H2 is generally present for even low H I column densities. Although the H I column density here is as high as N(H I) ~ 2×1021 cm-2, we observe 2N(H2)/N(H I) << 10-6. We cannot exclude the possibility that some H2 could be in very dense, small, and discrete clumps that cannot be detected with the present observation. However, the remarkable absence of diffuse H2 in this metal-poor galaxy can be explained by the low abundance of dust grains (needed to form this molecule from H atoms), the high ultraviolet flux, and the low density of the H I cloud surrounding the star-forming regions. Thus, having eliminated diffuse H2 as a significant contributor to the total mass, it appears that the gas of the galaxy is dominated by H I and that the high dynamical mass is not composed of cold and diffuse baryonic dark matter.},

	Abstract = {We report on measurements of interstellar O VI, H2, P II, Si II, Ar I, and Fe II absorption along the line of sight to Sk -67$\,^{\circ}$05, a B0 Ia star in a diffuse H II region in the western edge of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find logN(O VI)=14.40+/-0.04 in the Milky Way component and, using the C IV column density from previous IUE observations, N(C IV)/N(O VI)=1.00+/-0.16, a value similar to other halo measurements made with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. In the LMC component, logN(O VI)=13.89+/-0.05 and N(C IV)/N(O VI)<0.4 (3 sigma), since only an upper limit on N(C IV) is available. Along this sight line, the LMC is rich in molecular hydrogen [logN(H2)=19.50+/-0.08] in the Milky Way, logN(H2)=14.95+/-0.08. A two-component fit for the excitation temperature of the molecular gas in the LMC gives T01=59+/-5 K for J=0, 1 and Tex=800+/-330 K for J=3, 4, 5. For the Milky Way, T01=99+30-20 K; no excitation temperature could be determined for the higher rotational states. The Milky Way and LMC gas-phase [Fe/P] abundances are ~0.6 and ~0.7 dex lower, respectively, than solar system abundances. These values are similar to [Fe/Zn] measurements for the Milky Way and LMC toward SN 1987A.},

	Abstract = {Observations of the B0.2 V star tau Scorpii have revealed unusual stellar wind characteristics: redshifted absorption in the far-ultraviolet O VI resonance doublet up to ~+250 km s-1 and extremely hard X-ray emission implying gas at temperatures in excess of 107 K. We describe a phenomenological model to explain these properties. We assume the wind of tau Sco consists of two components: ambient gas in which denser clumps are embedded. The clumps are optically thick in the UV resonance lines primarily responsible for accelerating the ambient wind. The reduced acceleration causes the clumps to slow and even infall, all the while being confined by the ram pressure of the outflowing ambient wind. We calculate detailed trajectories of the clumps in the ambient stellar wind, accounting for a line radiation driving force and the momentum deposited by the ambient wind in the form of drag. We show that these clumps will fall back toward the star with velocities of several hundred km s-1 for a broad range of initial conditions. The velocities of the clumps relative to the ambient stellar wind can approach 2000 km s-1, producing X-ray-emitting plasmas with temperatures in excess of (1-6)×107 K in bow shocks at their leading edge. The infalling material explains the peculiar redshifted absorption wings seen in the O VI doublet. Of order 103 clumps with individual masses mc~1019-1020 g are needed to explain the observed X-ray luminosity and also to explain the strength of the O VI absorption lines. These values correspond to a mass-loss rate in clumps of Mc~10-9 to 10-8 Msolar yr-1, a small fraction of the total mass-loss rate (M~3×10-8 Msolar yr-1). We discuss the position of tau Sco in the H-R diagram, concluding that tau Sco is in a crucial position on the main sequence. Hotter stars near the spectral type of tau Sco have too powerful winds for clumps to fall back to the stars, and cooler stars have too low mass-loss rates to produce observable effects. The model developed here can be generally applied to line-driven outflows with clumps or density irregularities.},

	Abstract = {We empirically confirm the theoretical branching ratio and oscillator strength for the weak Mg II 3s-4p doublet at 1240 {\AA} as determined by Theodosiou & Federman. We use the independent methods of apparent optical depth analysis for the sight lines toward mu Col, gamma Ara, and rho Leo and profile component fitting for the sight line toward mu Col in order to determine the branching ratio. We find f1239/f1240=1.74+/-0.06, in agreement with the theoretical value of 1.78+/-0.03. Profile fitting for the line of sight toward mu Col gives an f-value for the doublet of 9.71+/-0.32x10-4, which agrees with both the theoretical value of Theodosiou & Federman and the empirical value of Fitzpatrick.

	Abstract = {We present model calculations of ionization fractions for elements in the warm (T~104 K), low-density photoionized interstellar medium (WIM) of the Milky Way. We model the WIM as a combination of overlapping low-excitation H II regions having n(H+)/n(H)>~0.8. Our adopted standard model incorporates an intrinsic elemental abundance pattern similar to that found for warm neutral clouds in the Galaxy and includes the effects of interstellar dust grains. The radiation field is characterized by an ionizing spectrum of a star with Teff~35,000 K and an ionization parameter log(q)~-4.0. The emergent emission-line strengths are in agreement with the observed ratios of [S II]/Halpha, [N II]/Halpha, [S II]/[N II], [O I]/Halpha, [O III]/Halpha, and He I/Halpha in the Galactic WIM. Although the forbidden emission-line intensities depend strongly on the input model parameters, the ionization fractions of the 20 elements studied in this work are robust over a wide range of physical conditions considered in the models. These ionization fractions have direct relevance to absorption-line determinations of the elemental abundances in the warm neutral and ionized gases in the Milky Way and other late-type galaxies. We demonstrate a method for estimating the WIM contributions to the observed column densities of singly and doubly ionized atoms used to derive abundances in the warm neutral gas. We apply this approach to study the gas-phase abundances of the warm interstellar clouds toward the halo star HD 93521.},

	Abstract = {We present a simple, effective approach for estimating the on-order backgrounds of spectra taken with the highest resolution modes of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Our scheme for determining the on-order background spectrum for STIS E140H and E230H observations uses moderate-order polynomial fits to the interorder scattered light visible in the two-dimensional STIS MAMA images. We present a suite of high-resolution STIS spectra to demonstrate that our background-subtraction routine produces the correct overall zero point as judged by the small residual flux levels in the centers of strongly saturated interstellar absorption lines. Although there are multiple sources of background light in STIS echelle mode data, this simple approach works very well for wavelengths longward of Lyalpha (lambda>~1215 {\AA}). At shorter wavelengths, the smaller order separation and generally lower signal-to-noise ratios of the data can reduce the effectiveness of our background estimation procedure. Slight artifacts in the background-subtracted spectrum can be seen in some cases, particularly at wavelengths of <~1300 {\AA}. Most of these are caused by echelle scattering of strong spectral features into the interorder light. We discuss the limitations of high-resolution STIS data in light of the uncertainties associated with our background-subtraction procedure. We compare our background-subtracted STIS spectra with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) Ech-A observations of the DA white dwarf G191-B2B and the GHRS first-order G160M observations of the early-type star HD 218915. We find no significant differences between the GHRS data and the STIS data reduced with our method in either case.

	Abstract = {We present new, deep optical images (BVI+Halpha) of the interstellar medium (ISM) far above the plane of the edge-on Sb galaxy NGC 891. These subarcsecond (0.8"-0.9") ground-based images give a direct visual view of two physically distinct ``phases'' of the thick interstellar disk of this galaxy. A dense, likely cold, phase of the thick disk ISM is observed in our BVI images as highly structured dust-bearing clouds viewed in absorption against the background stellar light of the galaxy. These dusty structures are traceable to heights |z|~2 kpc from the midplane. Though our data are deep enough to identify such clouds at higher z, very few highly structured dust features are present at |z|>~2 kpc. If the more prominent dust structures have Galactic gas-to-dust ratios, then they have gas masses in excess of 105 Msolar, each having visual extinctions well in excess of unity. A warm ionized phase of the high-z ISM is observed through its well-studied Halpha emission. Our images of this medium, to date the highest resolution observations of the warm ionized medium in NGC 891, show that the diffuse ionized medium in this galaxy is relatively smoothly distributed with some filamentary structure superposed on this smooth background. Our data show very little correspondence between the Halpha-emitting material and the absorbing dust structures. These two phases of the multiphase high-z ISM are physically distinct. The material traced by Halpha emission is much more smoothly distributed than that traced by the absorbing dust clouds, and it is clear that the Halpha emission is being heavily extincted in many places by the dense dust-bearing medium. The high-z dust clouds in NGC 891 are a major component of the multiphase halo medium. The mass found in the cold dense, warm neutral, and warm ionized phases are for |z|>0.4 kpc are comparable and of order a fewx108 Msolar. Our discussion of the physics of the multiphase medium at high z relies heavily on the theoretical work of Wolfire et al., and we suggest the dense phase of the thick disk ISM exists to |z|<~2 kpc because the thermal pressures of the warm and hot phases in this region are sufficient for its maintenance. Our Halpha observations show evidence for several discrete H II regions at large distances from the midplane (0.6<~|z|<~2.0 kpc). The presence of these H II regions in the thick disk of NGC 891 suggests that ongoing star formation may be present in some of the dense, high-z clouds visible in our images.

	Abstract = {This work presents observations of edge-on spiral galaxies using the WIYN 3.5-m observatory on Kitt Peak designed to dust in the disk-halo interface of spirals. High-resolution ( 0.'' 6 - 0.'' 8 ) broadband BVRI and narrowband Ha images of the edge-on Sb galaxy NGC 891. These images reveal a complex network of hundreds of dust absorbing structures far from the mid- plane of the galaxy, visible to |z|>~ 2.5 kpc from the midplane. However, the number and attenuation of highly-structured (clumped) dust clouds is significantly lesser at heights in excess of z ~ 1.7-2.0 kpc than at lower z. These high- z dusty clouds are estimated to have gas column densities NH >~ 1021 cm-2, with in excess of 10 5 Msolar , and gravitational potential energies > 1052 ergs, assuming Galactic gas-to-dust relationships. The Halpha data presented herein show a lack of small-scale correspondence between the dust features visible in the BVRI images and extraplanar ionized gas. An imaging survey of 12 nearby edge-on spirals shows extraplanar dust like that observed in NGC 891 is a common feature of spiral galaxies. In a statistical sample of seven massive L*- like spiral galaxies within D <~ 25 Mpc that have inclinations i >~ 87$\,^{\circ}$ from the plane of the sky, five of these systems show extraplanar dust. All of the galaxies in our sample that show detectable Halpha emission at large z also show extraplanar dust structures. None of those galaxies for which extraplanar Halpha searches were negative show evidence for extensive high- z dust. The dust-bearing clouds revealed in our broadband images likely represent a dense phase of the ISM in the interstellar thick disk of NGC 891 and other galaxies, physically distinct from the ionized phase of the high- z ISM. All of the phases of the interstellar medium observed in the disk of the Milky Way are also present in the extended thick disks, or halos, of spiral galaxies. The existence of the dense, extraplanar dust structures seen in our images is dictated by the pressure of the high-z interstellar medium.},

	Abstract = {Models of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way suggest that the observed abundances of elements heavier than helium (`metals') require a continuous infall of gas with metallicity (metal abundance) about 0.1 times the solar value. An infall rate integrated over the entire disk of the Milky Way of ~1 solar mass per year can solve the `G-dwarf problem'-the observational fact that the metallicities of most long-lived stars near the Sun lie in a relatively narrow range. This infall dilutes the enrichment arising from the production of heavy elements in stars, and thereby prevents the metallicity of the interstellar medium from increasing steadily with time. However, in other spiral galaxies, the low-metallicity gas needed to provide this infall has been observed only in associated dwarf galaxies and in the extreme outer disk of the Milky Way. In the distant Universe, low-metallicity hydrogen clouds (known as `damped Lyalpha absorbers') are sometimes seen near galaxies. Here we report a metallicity of 0.09 times solar for a massive cloud that is falling into the disk of the Milky Way. The mass flow associated with this cloud represents an infall per unit area of about the theoretically expected rate, and ~0.1-0.2 times the amount required for the whole Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We present ultraviolet interstellar absorption-line measurements for the sightline toward the O9.5 V star mu Columbae (l=237.3d, b=-27.1d d~400 pc, z~180 pc; <nHI>~0.06 cm-3) obtained with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. These archival data represent the most complete GHRS interstellar absorption-line measurements for any line of sight toward an early-type star. The 3.5 km s-1 resolution of the instrument allows us to accurately derive the gas-phase column densities of many important ionic species in the diffuse warm neutral medium, including accounting for saturation effects in the data and for contamination from ionized gas along this sightline. For the low-velocity material (-20<~vLSR<~+15 km s-1), we use the apparent column density method to derive column densities. For the individual absorbing components at vLSR~-28.8, +20.1, +31.0, and +41.2 km s-1, we apply component fitting techniques to derive column densities and b-values. We have also used observations of interstellar Lyalpha absorption taken with the GHRS intermediate resolution gratings to accurately derive the H I column density along this sightline. The resulting interstellar column density, logN(H I)=19.86+/-0.015, is in agreement with other determinations but is significantly more precise. The low-velocity material shows gas-phase abundance patterns similar to the warm cloud (cloud A) toward the disk star zeta Ophiuchi, while the component at vLSR~+20.1 km s-1 shows gas-phase abundances similar to those found in warm halo clouds. We find that the velocity-integrated gas-phase abundances of Zn, P, and S relative to H along this sightline are indistinguishable from solar system abundances. We discuss the implications of our gas-phase abundance measurements for the composition of interstellar dust grains. We find a dust-phase abundance [(Fe+Mg)/Sid=2.7-3.3 in the low-velocity gas; therefore the dust cannot be composed solely of common silicate grains, but must also include oxides or pure iron grains. The low-velocity material along this sightline is characterized by T~6000-7000 K with ne~0.3 cm-3, derived from the ionization equilibrium of Mg and Ca. The relative ionic column density ratios of the intermediate-velocity components at vLSR=+31.0 and +41.2 km s-1 show the imprint both of elemental incorporation into grains and (photo)ionization. These clouds have low total hydrogen column densities [logN(H)~17.4-17.7], and our component fitting b-values constrain the temperature in the highest velocity component to be T=4000+/-700 K. The electron density of this cloud is ne~0.6 cm-3, derived from the 2P1/2 to 2P3/2 fine structure excitation of C II. The components at vLSR~-30 and -48 km s-1 along this sightline likely trace shocked gas with very low hydrogen column densities. The vLSR~-30 km s-1 component is detected in a few strong low-ionization lines, while both are easily detected in Si III. The relative column densities of the -30 km s-1 suggest that the gas is collisionally ionized at moderate temperatures (T~25,000 K). This is consistent with the measured b-values of this component, though nonthermal motions likely contribute significantly to the observed breadths.

	Abstract = {Recent high-resolution observations of metal absorption lines in high-redshift damped Lyalpha systems have shown that Al III, a tracer of moderately ionized gas, very often has a velocity structure indistinguishable from that of low-ionization gas. Regions of ionized and neutral hydrogen in these systems are likely cospatial. The higher ionization Si IV and C IV absorption shows a much weaker or nonexistent correlation with the low-ionization material, implying that the regions traced by Al III are photoionized by a soft (stellar) spectrum, by a hard (power-law) spectrum with a very low ionization parameter, or a combination of both. We discuss the ionization of the damped Lyalpha systems and use photoionization equilibrium models to make quantitative estimates of its effects on abundance studies in these systems. We show that ionization effects may be large enough to account for the observed dispersion in absolute metal abundances in damped Lyalpha systems, causing systematically higher abundances in lower column density systems. The observed Si+/Fe+ and Zn+/Cr+ ratios may systematically overestimate the intrinsic Si/Fe and Zn/Cr ratios, respectively, if ionized gas is present in these systems, thereby mimicking the effects of alpha-element enrichment or dust depletion.},

	Abstract = {We present interstellar absorption-line measurements of the ions S III and Al III toward the stars beta1 Sco, mu Col, xi Per, zeta Oph, rho Leo, and HD 18100 using archival data from the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The ions Al III and S III trace heavily depleted and nondepleted elements, respectively, in ionized gas along the sight lines to these late-O/early-B stars. We use the photoionization equilibrium code CLOUDY to derive the ionization correction relating the ratio N(Al III) / N(S III) to the gas-phase abundance [Al/S]i [≡log (N(Al)/N(S))i-log(Al/S)solar] in the ionized gas. For spectral types considered here, the corrections range from 0.1 to 0.3 dex and are independent of the assumed ionization parameter, i.e., the ratio of ionizing photon density to mean electron density. Using the results of these photoionization models, we find [Al/S]i~-1.0 in the ionized gas toward beta1 Sco, xi Per, and zeta Oph; along the low-density path toward mu Col we find [Al/S]i~-0.8. Since S is not depleted onto grains, these values of [Al/S]i (~[Al/H]i) imply that Al-bearing grains are present in the ionized nebulae around these stars. If the warm ionized medium (WIM) of the Galaxy is photoionized by OB stars, the observations of rho Leo and HD 18100 imply [Al/S]i=-0.4 to -0.5 in the WIM and thus the presence of dust grains containing Al in this important phase of the interstellar medium. While photoionization appears to be the most likely origin of the ionization for Al III and S III, we cannot rule out confusion from the presence of hot, collisionally ionized gas along the sight lines to beta1 Sco and HD 18100. We find that [Al/S]i in the ionized gas along the six sight lines is anticorrelated with the electron density and average sight-line neutral density. The degree of grain destruction in the ionized medium of the Galaxy is not much higher than in the warm neutral medium. The existence of grains in the ionized regions studied here has important implications for the thermal balance of these regions.

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (0.6" to ~1.0") BV images of 12 edge-on spiral galaxies observed with the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. These images were obtained to search for extraplanar (|z|>0.4 kpc) absorbing dust structures similar to those previously found in NGC 891 (Howk & Savage). Many of these galaxies have been previously searched for diffuse ionized gas at high z. Our imaged galaxies include a sample of seven massive L_*-like spiral galaxies within D<~25 Mpc that have inclinations i>~87^deg from the plane of the sky. We find that five of these seven systems show extraplanar dust, visible as highly structured absorbing clouds against the background stellar light of the galaxies. These dust structures lie at heights |z|>~0.4 kpc, which should be above most of the thin disk molecular material in these galaxies. The more prominent structures are estimated to have associated gas masses >~10^5 M_solar the implied potential energies are >~10^52 ergs. All of the galaxies in our sample that show detectable Halpha emission at large z also show extraplanar dust structures. None of those galaxies for which extraplanar Halpha searches were negative show evidence for extensive high-z dust. The existence of extraplanar dust is a common property of massive spiral galaxies. We discuss several mechanisms for shaping the observed dust features. We emphasize in this discussion the possibility that these dusty clouds represent the dense phase of a multiphase medium at high z in spiral galaxies. In a few cases interactions with close galaxy companions could be responsible for the high-z dust, either through dynamical stripping or triggered star formation. We can rule out warps as the source of the observed high-z dust. Flaring gas layers seem an unlikely source of the observed material but cannot be ruled out at this time, except for those features that clearly connect to energetic processes in the disk. The correlation between high-z dust and extraplanar Halpha emission may simply suggest that both trace the high-z interstellar medium in its various forms (or phases), the existence of which may ultimately be driven by vigorous star formation in the underlying disk. The absorption produced by high-z dust and associated gas in spiral galaxies must be accounted for when studying extraplanar emission from spiral galaxies over much of the electromagnetic spectrum.},

	Abstract = {Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph echelle-mode observations of the interstellar absorption lines of Mg II, Si IV, C IV, and N V toward mu Columbae (HD 38666) are presented. The observations have a spectral resolution of 3.5 km s^-1 and signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) of 20-200. The mu Col sight line (l=237.3d, b=-27.1d, d=0.40 kpc, z=-0.18 kpc) extends though the Local Bubble and the warm neutral, warm ionized, and hot ionized phases of the interstellar medium (ISM). The high-ionization column densities toward mu Col are log N(Si IV)=12.16+/-0.05, log N(C IV)=12.88+/-0.02, and logN(N V)=11.8-12.3. Profile fits to Copernicus satellite measures of O VI absorption toward mu Col yield log N(O VI)=13.82+/-0.01 and b=38.7 km s^-1. This implies N(C IV)/N(O VI)=0.11+/-0.01, which is typical of the values found for the hot ISM of the Galactic disk. The O VI profile is twice as broad as the C IV and N V profiles, even though these species have roughly similar average velocities. Some of the C IV, N V, and O VI absorption toward mu Col may occur at the interface of the Local Cloud and Local Bubble, although additional contributions to these ions probably also occur in more distant gas along the sight line. A substantial part of the Si IV absorption likely arises in warm photoionized gas in an H II region surrounding mu Col. The profile width differences among the high-ionization lines of C IV, N V, and O VI could be produced if the line of sight passes through a highly evolved supernova remnant. The observations for mu Col and for other stars observed at high resolution with the GHRS reveal that multiple gas types (warm and hot) contribute to the absorption by the highly ionized atoms along both nearby and distant sight lines. Disentangling the relative contributions from the different gas types requires high-resolution and high-S/N observations. The Mg II observations, combined with a solar Mg reference abundance, imply that the Mg depletion toward mu Col is -0.31 dex. As observed for other sight lines through the warm neutral medium, the gas-phase observations of Mg, when combined with results for Fe and Si, suggest that Mg and Fe are more deficient from the gas phase than one would expect if these elements are only contained in silicate dust grains.},

@article{wakker1998,
	Abstract = {Based on the detection of C IV absorption in five Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) stars observed with the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope, we present the first unambiguous evidence that C+3 exists in the LMC away from regions where it could have been locally produced. We can exclude that this C+3 is associated with hot early-type stars or active regions. Significant differences between the Halpha and C+3 velocities toward our probes indicate that H+ and C+3 are not cospatial. Large column density variations show that the distribution of C+3 is not uniform. The properties of the LMC C IV lines are similar but not identical to those found for the Milky Way: 45 km s-1 versus 73 km s-1 for the average FWHM, (8-12) × 1013 cm-2 versus (9-16) × 1013 cm-2 for the average column density. The Halpha versus C IV velocity differences and the similarity of the properties of the LMC and Milky Way C IV absorption suggest that at least some of the C+3 in the LMC is in a hot corona and that it has been produced by processes similar to those in the Milky Way. Our results show the feasibility of detecting high-ionization absorption in faint LMC stars, but more observations will be necessary before we can understand the distribution and properties of 105 K gas in the LMC.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. Also based on observations with the IUE satellite, sponsored and operated by NASA, by the Science and Engineering Research Council, and by the European Space Agency.},

@article{howk1997,
	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (0.6"-0.65") optical broad-band images of the edge-on Sb galaxy NGC 891 obtained with the WIYN 3.5-m telescope. These BVR images reveal a complex network of hundreds of dust absorbing structures far from the mid-plane of the galaxy. The dust structures have a wide range of morphologies and are clearly visible to [zeta]<=1.5 kpc from the mid-plane. In this paper we discuss the general characteristics of the population of absorbing structures, as well as physical properties of 12 individual features. These 12 structures are characterized by NH$\pm$ 1021 cm-2, with masses estimated to be more than 2 x 105-5 x 106 Msun, assuming Galactic gas-to-dust relationships. The gravitational potential energies of the individual dust structures, given their observed heights and derived masses, lie in the range of 20- 200×1051 ergs, which represents the energy input of at least tens to hundreds of supernovae. Rough number counts of extraplanar dust features find <=120 structures at [zeta]>400 pc with apparent B-band extinction >=0.25 mag. If these have similar properties to those structures studied in detail, the mass of high zeta gas associated with extraplanar dust in NGC 891 likely exceeds 2 X 108 Msun, which is ˜2% of the total neutral ISM mass of the galaxy. The absorbing properties of extraplanar dust structures in NGC 891 are best fit with Rv=Av/E(B - V) = 3.6$\pm$0.4. A comparison of the new WIYN images with an archival Hubble Space Telescope image of the central region of NGC 891 suggests that the quantities we measure for the extraplanar dust features are not seriously affected by atmospheric blurring in the WIYN images. Some of the dust features seen in NGC 891 suggest supernova-driven galactic fountain or chimney phenomena are responsible for their production and are clearly associated with ionized gas structures thought to be tracing the violent disk-halo interface of this galaxy. However, other structures are not so readily associated with these energetic processes. We discuss several mechanisms which may produce high-zeta dust structures such as those seen in the WlYN and HST images presented here. It is, however, less than clear which of these mechanisms are primarily responsible for the extensive extraplanar dust structures seen in our images. The data presented are part of a larger program to search for and characterize off-plane dust structures in edge-on systems.},

	Abstract = {A lower limit to the distance of the high-velocity cloud (HVC) complex A of 4 kpc (z > 3 kpc) is derived. The HVC is detected toward the Seyfert galaxy Mrk 106 in Mg II lambdalambda2796, 2803 absorption spectra taken with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proving that Mg^+^ is present in the cloud. It is not detected in the Mg II spectra of two stars, PG 0859+593 (distance 4 kpc) and PG 0906+597 (distance 0.7 kpc). The distances to the stars are derived by matching Stromgren photometry and intermediate-resolution spectroscopy with model stellar atmospheres; they are estimated to be accurate to within 1 kpc. From a combination of Effelsberg data and Westerbork maps with 2' or 3' resolution, we show that the H I column density and thus the Mg^+^ abundance in the direction of the two stars is sufficiently high for the nondetections to imply that the HVC is behind the stars. This distance limit can be used to eliminate several recent models for complex A that placed it nearby. We also derive a distance bracket of 1.7 < d < 4 kpc (1.1 < z < 3 kpc) for an intermediate-velocity cloud (IVC) at velocities of about -50 km s^-1^. This IVC was named the Low-Latitude Intermediate-Velocity Arch by Kuntz & Danly and is seen between l = 120^deg^-160^deg^ and b = 30^deg^- 45^deg^.},

@article{kacprzak2012,
	Abstract = {We report a bimodality in the azimuthal angle distribution of gas around galaxies as traced by Mg II absorption: halo gas prefers to exist near the projected galaxy major and minor axes. The bimodality is demonstrated by computing the mean azimuthal angle probability distribution function using 88 spectroscopically confirmed Mg II-absorption-selected galaxies [Wr (2796) >= 0.1 {\AA}] and 35 spectroscopically confirmed non-absorbing galaxies [Wr (2796) < 0.1 {\AA}] imaged with Hubble Space Telescope and Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The azimuthal angle distribution for non-absorbers is flat, indicating no azimuthal preference for gas characterized by Wr (2796) < 0.1 {\AA}. We find that blue star-forming galaxies clearly drive the bimodality while red passive galaxies may exhibit an excess along their major axis. These results are consistent with galaxy evolution scenarios where star-forming galaxies accrete new gas, forming new stars and producing winds, while red galaxies exist passively due to reduced gas reservoirs. We further compute an azimuthal angle dependent Mg II absorption covering fraction, which is enhanced by as much as 20%-30% along the major and minor axes. The Wr (2796) distribution for gas along the major axis is likely skewed toward weaker Mg II absorption than for gas along the projected minor axis. These combined results are highly suggestive that the bimodality is driven by gas accreted along the galaxy major axis and outflowing along the galaxy minor axis. Adopting these assumptions, we find that the opening angle of outflows and inflows to be 100$\,^{\circ}$ and 40$\,^{\circ}$, respectively. We find that the probability of detecting outflows is ~60%, implying that winds are more commonly observed.},

	Abstract = {Numerical simulations suggest that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) play an important role in the formation of early-type galaxies by expelling gas and dust in powerful galactic winds and quenching star formation. However, the existence of AGN feedback capable of halting galaxy-wide star formation has yet to be observationally confirmed. To investigate this question, we have obtained spectra of 14 poststarburst galaxies at z~0.6 to search for evidence of galactic winds. In 10/14 galaxies we detect Mg  II lambdalambda2796, 2803 absorption lines that are blueshifted by 490-2020 km s-1 with respect to the stars. The median blueshift is 1140 km s-1. We hypothesize that the outflowing gas represents a fossil galactic wind launched near the peak of the galaxy's activity, a few 100 Myr ago. The velocities we measure are intermediate between those of luminous starbursts and broad absorption line quasars, which suggests that feedback from an AGN may have played a role in expelling cool gas and shutting down star formation.  Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution.},

@article{hopkins2006,
	Abstract = {We present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas, producing starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, n dot(Lpeak,z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so n dot(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the ``break'' in the observed luminosity function. From n dot(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, without invoking ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions. We provide a library of Monte Carlo realizations of our models for comparison with observations.},

@article{stewart2011a,
	Abstract = {We use cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to study the cool, accreted gas in two Milky Way size galaxies through cosmic time to z = 0. We find that gas from mergers and cold flow accretion results in significant amounts of cool gas in galaxy halos. This cool circum-galactic component drops precipitously once the galaxies cross the critical mass to form stable shocks, M vir = M sh ~ 1012 M sun. Before reaching M sh, the galaxies experience cold mode accretion (T < 105 K) and show moderately high covering fractions in accreted gas: fc ~ 30%-50% for R < 50 comoving kpc and N_{H I}>10^{16} cm-2. These values are considerably lower than observed covering fractions, suggesting that outflowing gas (not included here) is important in simulating galaxies with realistic gaseous halos. Within ~500 Myr of crossing the M sh threshold, each galaxy transitions to hot mode gas accretion, and fc drops to ~5%. The sharp transition in covering fraction is primarily a function of halo mass, not redshift. This signature should be detectable in absorption system studies that target galaxies of varying host mass, and may provide a direct observational tracer of the transition from cold flow accretion to hot mode accretion in galaxies.},

@article{rupke2013,
	Abstract = {Massive, galaxy-scale outflows are known to be ubiquitous in major mergers of disk galaxies in the local universe. In this paper, we explore the multiphase structure and power sources of galactic winds in six ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z < 0.06 using deep integral field spectroscopy with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini North. We probe the neutral, ionized, and dusty gas phases using Na I D, strong emission lines ([O I], Halpha, and [N II]), and continuum colors, respectively. We separate outflow motions from those due to rotation and tidal perturbations, and find that all of the galaxies in our sample host high-velocity flows on kiloparsec scales. The properties of these outflows are consistent with multiphase (ionized, neutral, and dusty) collimated bipolar winds emerging along the minor axis of the nuclear disk to scales of 1-2 kpc. In two cases, these collimated winds take the form of bipolar superbubbles, identified by clear kinematic signatures. Less collimated (but still high-velocity) flows are also present on scales up to 5 kpc in most systems. The three galaxies in our sample with obscured QSOs host higher velocity outflows than those in the three galaxies with no evidence for an active galactic nucleus. The peak outflow velocity in each of the QSOs is in the range 1450-3350 km s-1, and the highest velocities (2000-3000 km s-1) are seen only in ionized gas. The outflow energy and momentum in the QSOs are difficult to produce from a starburst alone, but are consistent with the QSO contributing significantly to the driving of the flow.

	Abstract = {We present an imaging and spectroscopic survey of galaxies in fields around QSOs HE 0226-4110, PKS 0405-123, and PG 1216+069. The fields are selected to have ultraviolet echelle spectra available, which uncover 195 Lyalpha absorbers and 13 O VI absorbers along the three sightlines. We obtain robust redshifts for 1104 galaxies of rest-frame absolute magnitude MR - 5log h lsim -16 and at projected physical distances rho lsim 4 h -1 Mpc from the QSOs. Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFPC2 images of the fields around PKS 0405-123 and PG 1216+069 are available for studying the optical morphologies of absorbing galaxies. Combining the absorber and galaxy data, we perform a cross-correlation study to understand the physical origin of Lyalpha and O VI absorbers and to constrain the properties of extended gas around galaxies. The results of our study are: (1) both strong Lyalpha absorbers of log N(H I) >= 14 and O VI absorbers exhibit a comparable clustering amplitude as emission-line-dominated galaxies and a factor of ≈ 6 weaker amplitude than absorption-line-dominated galaxies on comoving projected distance scales of rp < 3 h -1 Mpc; (2) weak Lyalpha absorbers of log N(H I)<13.5 appear to cluster very weakly around galaxies; (3) none of the absorption-line-dominated galaxies at rp <= 250 h -1 kpc has a corresponding O VI absorber to a sensitive upper limit of W(1031) lsim 0.03 {\AA}, while the covering fraction of O VI absorbing gas around emission-line-dominated galaxies is found to be kappa ≈ 64%; and (4) high-resolution images of five O VI absorbing galaxies show that these galaxies exhibit disk-like morphologies with mildly disturbed features on the edge. Together, the data indicate that O VI absorbers arise preferentially in gas-rich galaxies. In addition, tidal debris in groups/galaxy pairs may be principally responsible for the observed O VI absorbers, particularly those of W(1031)>70 m{\AA}.  Observations reported here were obtained in part at the Magellan telescopes, a collaboration between the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, University of Arizona, Harvard University, University of Michigan, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

	Abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise optical spectra for 67 low-redshift (0.1 < z < 0.4) galaxies that lie within close projected distances (5 kpc < rho < 150 kpc) of 38 background UV-bright QSOs. The Keck LRIS and Magellan MagE data presented here are part of a survey that aims to construct a statistically sampled map of the physical state and metallicity of gaseous galaxy halos using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. We provide a detailed description of the optical data reduction and subsequent spectral analysis that allow us to derive the physical properties of this uniquely data-rich sample of galaxies. The galaxy sample is divided into 38 pre-selected L ~ L*, z ~ 0.2 "target" galaxies and 29 "bonus" galaxies that lie in close proximity to the QSO sightlines. We report galaxy spectroscopic redshifts accurate to $\pm$30 km s-1, impact parameters, rest-frame colors, stellar masses, total star formation rates (SFRs), and gas-phase interstellar medium oxygen abundances. When we compare the distribution of these galaxy characteristics to those of the general low-redshift population, we find good agreement. The L ~ L* galaxies in this sample span a diverse range of color (1.0 < u - r < 3.0), stellar mass (109.5 < M/M &sun; < 1011.5), and SFRs (0.01-20 M &sun; yr-1). These optical data, along with the COS UV spectroscopy, comprise the backbone of our efforts to understand how halo gas properties may correlate with their host galaxy properties, and ultimately to uncover the processes that drive gas outflow and/or are influenced by gas inflow.},

@article{heckman2011,
	Abstract = {The source responsible for reionizing the universe at z>6 remains uncertain. While an energetically adequate population of star-forming galaxies may be in place, it is unknown whether a large enough fraction of their ionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium. Attempts to measure this escape fraction in intensely star-forming galaxies at lower redshifts have largely yielded upper limits. In this paper, we present new Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and archival Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) far-UV spectroscopy of a sample of 11 Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs), a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble the high-z Lyman Break galaxies. We combine these data with Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectra and Spitzer photometry. We also analyze archival FUSE observations of 15 typical UV-bright local starbursts. We find evidence of small covering factors for optically thick neutral gas in three cases. This is based on two independent pieces of evidence: a significant residual intensity in the cores of the strongest interstellar absorption-lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratio of extinction-corrected Halpha to UV plus far-IR luminosities. These objects represent three of the four LBAs that contain a young, very compact (~102 pc), and highly massive (~109 M sun) dominant central object (DCO). These three objects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount of blueshifted Lyalpha emission, which may be related to the low covering factor of neutral gas. All four LBAs with DCOs in our sample show extremely high velocity outflows of interstellar gas, with line centroids blueshifted by about 700 km s-1 and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500 km s-1. We show that these properties are consistent with an outflow driven by a powerful starburst that is exceptionally compact. We speculate that such extreme feedback may be required to enable the escape of ionizing radiation from star-forming galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Template fits to observed galaxy fluxes allow calculation of K-corrections and conversions among observations of galaxies at various wavelengths. We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, nonnegative matrix factorization, is akin to principal component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta-function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broadband fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0<z<1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are interpretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star formation histories. We present templates fitted with this method to data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In addition, we present software for using such data to estimate K-corrections.},

@article{tully1987,
	Abstract = {The 2367 galaxies in the Nearby Galaxies Catalog (Tully, 1987) have been assigned to clouds, associations, and groups. The group assignments follow from a dendogram analysis with linkages based on an estimator of the gravitational force between entities. The procedure naturally accounts for the effects of tides. Groups are defined by a specific density threshold. Within the radius of reasonable completion of 25/h75 Mpc, 179 groups have been identified that include 69 percent of the known galaxies and 77 percent of the light. An additional 20 percent of the galaxies are in associations, and 10 percent of the galaxies are at-large in clouds. Less than 1 percent of galaxies are by themselves outside of clouds. Evidence is presented that the groups are collapsed and that many should be virialized. There is no indication of a serious interloper problem. The properties of the 49 groups with five or more members show less scatter than was the case with previously identified groups. The median virial radius is 340/h75 kpc, the median velocity dispersion is 100 km/s, and the median value of M(V)/L(B)(b, i) is 94h75 (solar mass)/(solar luminosity).},

	Abstract = {We map the radial and azimuthal distribution of Mg II gas within ~ 200 kpc (physical) of ~ 4000 galaxies at redshifts 0.5 < z < 0.9 using co-added spectra of more than 5000 background galaxies at z > 1. We investigate the variation of Mg II rest-frame equivalent width (EW) as a function of the radial impact parameter for different subsets of foreground galaxies selected in terms of their rest-frame colors and masses. Blue galaxies have a significantly higher average Mg II EW at close galactocentric radii as compared to the red galaxies. Among the blue galaxies, there is a correlation between Mg II EW and galactic stellar mass of the host galaxy. We also find that the distribution of Mg II absorption around group galaxies is more extended than that for non-group galaxies, and that groups as a whole have more extended radial profiles than individual galaxies. Interestingly, these effects can be satisfactorily modeled by a simple superposition of the absorption profiles of individual member galaxies, assuming that these are the same as those of non-group galaxies, suggesting that the group environment may not significantly enhance or diminish the Mg II absorption of individual galaxies. We show that there is a strong azimuthal dependence of the Mg II absorption within 50 kpc of inclined disk-dominated galaxies, indicating the presence of a strongly bipolar outflow aligned along the disk rotation axis. There is no significant dependence of Mg II absorption on the apparent inclination angle of disk-dominated galaxies.

	Abstract = {The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of late-type galaxies is characterized using UV spectroscopy of 11 targeted QSO/galaxy pairs at z <= 0.02 with the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and ~60 serendipitous absorber/galaxy pairs at z <= 0.2 with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. CGM warm cloud properties are derived, including volume filling factors of 3%-5%, cloud sizes of 0.1-30 kpc, masses of 10-108 M &sun;, and metallicities of ~0.1-1 Z &sun;. Almost all warm CGM clouds within 0.5 R vir are metal-bearing and many have velocities consistent with being bound, "galactic fountain" clouds. For galaxies with L >~ 0.1 L*, the total mass in these warm CGM clouds approaches 1010 M &sun;, ~10%-15% of the total baryons in massive spirals and comparable to the baryons in their parent galaxy disks. This leaves >~ 50% of massive spiral-galaxy baryons "missing." Dwarfs (<0.1 L*) have smaller area covering factors and warm CGM masses (<=5% baryon fraction), suggesting that many of their warm clouds escape. Constant warm cloud internal pressures as a function of impact parameter (P/k ~ 10 cm-3 K) support the inference that previous COS detections of broad, shallow O VI and Lyalpha absorptions are of an extensive (~400-600 kpc), hot (T ≈ 106 K), intra-cloud gas which is very massive (>=1011 M &sun;). While the warm CGM clouds cannot account for all the "missing baryons" in spirals, the hot intra-group gas can, and could account for ~20% of the cosmic baryon census at z ~ 0 if this hot gas is ubiquitous among spiral groups.

	Abstract = {We analyze the association of galaxies with Lyalpha and O VI absorption, the most commonly detected transitions of the low-z intergalactic medium (IGM), in the fields of 14 quasars with z em = 0.06-0.57. Confirming previous studies, we observe a high covering fraction for Lyalpha absorption to impact parameter rho = 300 h -1 72 kpc: 33/37 of our L > 0.01 L* galaxies show Lyalpha equivalent width W Lyalpha >= 50 m{\AA}. Galaxies of all luminosity L > 0.01 L* and spectral type are surrounded by a diffuse and ionized circumgalactic medium (CGM), whose baryonic mass is estimated at ~1010.5 $\pm$ 0.3 M sun for a constant N H = 1019 cm-2. The virialized halos and extended CGM of present-day galaxies are responsible for most strong Lyalpha absorbers (W Lyalpha > 300 m{\AA}) but cannot reproduce the majority of observed lines in the Lyalpha forest. We conclude that the majority of Lyalpha absorption with W Lyalpha = 30-300 m{\AA} occurs in the cosmic web predicted by cosmological simulations and estimate a characteristic width for these filaments of ≈400 h -1 72 kpc. Regarding O VI, we observe a near unity covering fraction to rho = 200 h -1 72 kpc for L > 0.1 L* galaxies and to rho = 300 h -1 72 kpc for sub-L* (0.1 L* < L < L*) galaxies. Similar to our Lyalpha results, stronger O VI systems (W 1031 > 70 m{\AA}) arise in the virialized halos of L > 0.1 L* galaxies. Unlike Lyalpha, the weaker O VI systems (W 1031 ≈ 30 m{\AA}) arise in the extended CGM of sub-L* galaxies. The majority of O VI gas observed in the low-z IGM is associated with a diffuse medium surrounding individual galaxies with L ≈ 0.3 L* and rarely originates in the so-called warm-hot IGM (predicted by cosmological simulations.},

@article{strauss2002,
	Abstract = {We describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies for spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) from the photometric data obtained by the imaging survey. Galaxy photometric properties are measured using the Petrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by the shape of the surface brightness profile. The metric aperture used is essentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foreground extinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. The main galaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band Petrosian magnitudes r<=17.77 and r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses mu50<=24.5 mag arcsec-2. These cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with a median redshift of 0.104. We carry out a number of tests to show that (1) our star-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellar contamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (2) the fraction of galaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small (~0.1%), (3) the completeness of the sample is high, exceeding 99%, and (4) the reproducibility of target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with the expected random photometric errors. The main cause of incompleteness is blending with saturated stars, which becomes more significant for brighter, larger galaxies. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N>4 per pixel) that essentially all targeted galaxies (99.9%) yield a reliable redshift (i.e., with statistical error less than 30 km s-1). About 6% of galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria are not observed because they have a companion closer than the 55" minimum separation of spectroscopic fibers, but these galaxies can be accounted for in statistical analyses of clustering or galaxy properties. The uniformity and completeness of the galaxy sample make it ideal for studies of large-scale structure and the characteristics of the galaxy population in the local universe.},

	Abstract = {Attention is given to the apparent optical depth method, a procedure for analyzing interstellar absorption lines. Observed absorption-line profiles are converted into profiles of apparent optical depth, and apparent column density per unit velocity. By comparing the latter for a given interstellar species having two or more absorption lines which differ in the product, the presence or absence of unresolved saturated structure in the profiles can be directly inferred. The method is illustrated using absorption-line data from the IUE satellite for the highly ionized gas toward HD 64760. Additional illustrations and a study of the method's accuracy are provided through a series of numerical simulations of multicomponent interstellar absorption situations. The method is compared to the standard growth curve method for deriving interstellar column densities. The principal value of the apparent optical depth method is that the absorption-line data are directly converted into a form that provides for direct scientific interpretations of the physical conditions in the interstellar absorbing medium as a function of velocity.},

	Abstract = {The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) is a moderate-resolution spectrograph with unprecedented sensitivity that was installed into the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 2009 May, during HST Servicing Mission 4 (STS-125). We present the design philosophy and summarize the key characteristics of the instrument that will be of interest to potential observers. For faint targets, with flux F lambda ≈ 1.0 × 10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 {\AA}-1, COS can achieve comparable signal to noise (when compared to Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph echelle modes) in 1%-2% of the observing time. This has led to a significant increase in the total data volume and data quality available to the community. For example, in the first 20 months of science operation (2009 September-2011 June) the cumulative redshift pathlength of extragalactic sight lines sampled by COS is nine times than sampled at moderate resolution in 19 previous years of Hubble observations. COS programs have observed 214 distinct lines of sight suitable for study of the intergalactic medium as of 2011 June. COS has measured, for the first time with high reliability, broad Lyalpha absorbers and Ne VIII in the intergalactic medium, and observed the He II reionization epoch along multiple sightlines. COS has detected the first CO emission and absorption in the UV spectra of low-mass circumstellar disks at the epoch of giant planet formation, and detected multiple ionization states of metals in extra-solar planetary atmospheres. In the coming years, COS will continue its census of intergalactic gas, probe galactic and cosmic structure, and explore physics in our solar system and Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {Galactic outflows of cool (~104 K) gas are ubiquitous in local starburst galaxies and in most high-redshift galaxies. Hot gas from supernovae has long been suspected as the primary driver, but this mechanism suffers from its tendency to destroy the cool gas. We propose a modification of the supernova scenario that overcomes this difficulty. Star formation is observed to take place in clusters. We show that, for L sstarf galaxies, the radiation pressure from clusters with M cl >~ 106 M sun is able to expel the surrounding gas at velocities in excess of the circular velocity vc of the disk galaxy. This cool gas travels above the galactic disk before supernovae erupt in the driving cluster. Once above the disk, the cool outflowing gas is exposed to radiation and hot gas outflows from the galactic disk, which in combination drive it to distances of ~50 kpc. Because the radiatively driven clouds grow in size as they travel, and because the hot gas is more dilute at large distance, the clouds are less subject to destruction. Therefore, unlike wind-driven clouds, radiatively driven clouds can give rise to the metal absorbers seen in quasar spectra. We identify these cluster-driven winds with large-scale galactic outflows. The maximum cluster mass in a galaxy is an increasing function of the galaxy's gas surface density, so only starburst galaxies are able to drive cold outflows. We find the critical star formation rate for launching large-scale cool outflows to be \dot{\Sigma }^{crit}_*\approx 0.05\, M_\odot \;yr ^{-1}\;kpc ^{-2}, in good agreement with observations.},

	Abstract = {We present complementary data on five intermediate-redshift (0.44<=z<=0.66) Mg II-absorbing galaxies, combining high spatial resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope, high-resolution quasi-stellar object (QSO) spectroscopy from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer, and galaxy kinematics from intermediate-resolution spectroscopy using the Keck Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer. These data allow a direct comparison of the kinematics of gas at large galactocentric impact parameters with the galaxy kinematics obtained from the faint galaxy spectroscopy. All five galaxies appear to be relatively normal spirals, with measured rotation curves yielding circular velocities in the range 100<=vc<=260 km s-1. The QSO sight lines have projected impact parameters to the absorbing galaxies in the range 14.5h-1kpc<=d<=75h-1 kpc; the galaxies have inclination angles with respect to the line of sight ranging from 40$\,^{\circ}$ to 75$\,^{\circ}$. We find that in four of the five cases examined, the velocities of all of the Mg II-absorption components lie entirely to one side of the galaxy systemic redshift. The fifth case, for which the galaxy is much less luminous than the other four, has narrow absorption centered at zero velocity with respect to systemic, despite having the largest disk inclination angle in the sample. These observations are consistent with rotation being dominant for the absorbing-gas kinematics; however, the total range of velocities observed is inconsistent with simple disk rotation in every case. Simple kinematic models that simultaneously explain both the systemic offset of the absorbing material relative to the galaxy redshifts and the total velocity width spanned by the absorption require either extremely thick rotating gas layers, rotation velocities that vary with z-height above the extrapolation of the galactic plane, or both. In any case, our small sample suggests that rotating ``halo'' gas is a common feature of intermediate-redshift spiral galaxies and that the kinematic signature of rotation dominates over radial infall or outflow even for gas well away from the galactic plane. We discuss possible explanations for this behavior and compare our observations with possible local analogs.  Based in part on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of extended C IV gaseous envelopes around galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type. First, we show that C IV absorption systems are strongly clustered around galaxies on velocity scales of v<~250 km s-1 and impact parameter scales of rho<~100 h-1 kpc, but not on larger velocity or impact parameter scales. Next, adopting measurements of galaxy properties presented in previous papers (which include B-band luminosity, surface brightness, and disk-to-bulge ratio), we examine how properties of the C IV absorption systems depend on properties of the galaxies. On the basis of 14 galaxy and absorber pairs and 36 galaxies that do not produce corresponding C IV absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits, we find that: (1) Galaxies of a range of morphological type and luminosity appear to possess extended C IV gaseous envelopes of radius R~100 h-1 kpc, with abrupt boundaries between the C IV absorbing and nonabsorbing regions. (2) The extent of C IV-absorbing gas around galaxies scales with galaxy B-band luminosity as R~L0.5+/-0.1B but does not depend strongly on galaxy surface brightness, redshift, or morphological type. (3) The covering factor of C IV clouds within ~100 h-1 kpc of galaxies is nearly unity, but there is a large scatter in the mean number of clouds encountered along the line of sight. After scaling to the luminosity of an L* galaxy, we find that 13 of 14 galaxies of impact parameter rho<100 h-1 kpc are associated with corresponding C IV absorption lines, while only one of 36 galaxies of impact parameter rho>100 h-1 kpc are associated with corresponding C IV absorption lines. The most significant implication of the study is that galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type are surrounded by chemically enriched gas that extends for at least ~100 h-1 kpc. We consider various scenarios that may have produced metals at large galactic distance and conclude that accreting satellites are most likely to be responsible for chemically enriched gas at large galactic distances to regular-looking galaxies.

	Abstract = {The spectrum of the low-redshift QSO PG 0953+415 (zQSO=0.234) shows two strong, intervening O VI absorption systems. To study the nature of these absorbers, we have used the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph to conduct a deep spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey in the 5'×5' field centered on the QSO. This survey is fully complete for r'<19.7 and is 73% complete for r'<21.0. We find three galaxies at the redshift of the higher z O VI system (zabs=0.14232), including a galaxy at projected distance rho=155 h-170 kpc. We find no galaxies in the Gemini field at the redshift of the lower z O VI absorber (zabs=0.06807), which indicates that the nearest galaxy is more than 195 h-170 kpc away or has L<0.04L*. Previous shallower surveys covering a larger field have shown that the zabs=0.06807 O VI absorber is affiliated with a group or filament of galaxies, but the nearest known galaxy has rho=736 h-170 kpc. The zabs=0.06807 absorber is notable for several reasons. The absorption profiles reveal simple kinematics indicative of quiescent material. The H I line widths and good alignment of the H I and metal lines favor photoionization, and moreover, the column density ratios imply a high metallicity: [M/H]=-0.3+/-0.12. The zabs=0.14232 O VI system is more complex and less constrained but also indicates a relatively high metallicity. Using galaxy redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we show that both of the PG 0953+415 O VI absorbers are located in large-scale filaments of the cosmic web. Evidently, some regions of the web filaments are highly metal enriched. We discuss the origin of the high-metallicity gas and suggest that the enrichment might have occurred long ago (at high z).

	Abstract = {Since the launch of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 9 yr ago, Cepheid distances to 25 galaxies have been determined for the purpose of calibrating secondary distance indicators. Eighteen of these have been measured by the HST Key Project team, six by the Supernova Calibration Project, and one independently by Tanvir. Collectively, this work sets out an array of survey markers over the region within 25 Mpc of the Milky Way. A variety of secondary distance indicators can now be calibrated, and the accompanying four papers employ the full set of 25 galaxies to consider the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies, Type Ia supernovae, and surface brightness fluctuations. When calibrated with Cepheid distances, each of these methods yields a measurement of the Hubble constant and a corresponding measurement uncertainty. We combine these measurements in this paper, together with a model of the velocity field, to yield the best available estimate of the value of H0 within the range of these secondary distance indicators and its uncertainty. The uncertainty in the result is modeled in an extensive simulation we call the ``virtual Key Project.'' The velocity-field model includes the influence of the Virgo cluster, the Great Attractor, and the Shapley supercluster, but does not play a significant part in determining the result. The result is H0=71+/-6 km s-1 Mpc-1. The largest contributor to the uncertainty of this 67% confidence level result is the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which has been assumed to be 50+/-3 kpc. This takes up the first 6.5% of our 9% error budget. Other contributors are the photometric calibration of the WFPC2 instrument, which takes up 4.5%, deviations from uniform Hubble flow in the volume sampled (<~2%), the composition sensitivity of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation (4%), and departures from a universal reddening law (~1%). These are the major components that , when combined in quadrature, make up the 9% total uncertainty. If the LMC distance modulus were systematically smaller by 1 sigma than that adopted here, the derived value of the Hubble constant would increase by 4 km s-1 Mpc-1. Most of the significant systematic errors are capable of amelioration in future work. These include the uncertainty in the photometric calibration of WFPC2, the LMC distance, and the reddening correction. A NICMOS study is in its preliminary reduction phase, addressing the last of these concerns. Various empirical analyses have suggested that Cepheid distance moduli are affected by metallicity differences. If we adopted the composition sensitivity obtained in the Key Project's study of M101, and employed the oxygen abundances measured spectroscopically in each of the Cepheid fields we have studied, the value of the Hubble constant would be reduced by 4%+/-2% to 68+/-6 km s-1 Mpc-1.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{stewart2011,
	Abstract = {We use cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to study the kinematic signatures of cool gas accretion onto a pair of well-resolved galaxy halos. We find that cold-flow streams and gas-rich mergers produce a circumgalactic component of cool gas that generally orbits with high angular momentum about the galaxy halo before falling in to build the disk. This signature of cosmological accretion should be observable using background-object absorption-line studies as features that are offset from the galaxy's systemic velocity by ~100 km s-1. In most cases, the accreted gas co-rotates with the central disk in the form of a warped, extended cold flow disk, such that the observed velocity offset will be in the same direction as galaxy rotation, appearing in sight lines that avoid the galactic poles. This prediction provides a means to observationally distinguish accreted gas from outflow gas: the accreted gas will show large one-sided velocity offsets in absorption-line studies while radial/bi-conical outflows will not (except possibly in special polar projections). Such a signature of rotation has already been seen in studies of intermediate-redshift galaxy-absorber pairs, and we suggest that these observations may be among the first to provide indirect observational evidence for cold accretion onto galactic halos. This cold-mode halo gas typically has ~3-5 times more specific angular momentum than the dark matter. The associated cold-mode disk configurations are likely related to extended H I/extended UV disks that are seen around galaxies in the local universe. The fraction of galaxies with extended cold flow disks and associated offset absorption-line gas should decrease around bright galaxies at low redshift as cold-mode accretion dies out.},

	Abstract = {Straightforward physical arguments are used to derive the properties of Lyalpha forest absorbers. It is shown that many aspects of the current physical picture of the forest, in particular the fact that the absorption arises in extended structures of moderate overdensities that contain a large fraction of the baryons in the universe, can be derived directly from the observations without making any specific assumptions about the presence and distribution of dark matter, the values of the cosmological parameters, or the mechanism for structure formation. The key argument is that along any line of sight intersecting a gravitationally confined gas cloud, the size of the region over which the density is of order the maximum density, is typically of order the local Jeans length. This is true for overdense absorbers, regardless of the shape of the cloud and regardless of whether the cloud as a whole is in dynamical equilibrium. The simple analytic model is used to derive the mass distribution of the photoionized gas directly from the observed column density distribution. It is demonstrated that the shape of the column density distribution, in particular the observed deviations from a single power law, and its evolution with redshift, reflect the shape of the matter distribution and can be understood in terms of the growth of structure via gravitational instability in an expanding universe.},

	Abstract = {The Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies ( 4G ) is an Exploration Science Legacy Program approved for the Spitzer post-cryogenic mission. It is a volume-, magnitude-, and size-limited ( d < 40 Mpc , | b | > 30 $\,^{\circ}$ , mBcorr < 15.5 , and D25 > 1') survey of 2331 galaxies using the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) at 3.6 and 4.5 mum. Each galaxy is observed for 240 s and mapped to >= 1.5 × D25 . The final mosaicked images have a typical 1sigma rms noise level of 0.0072 and 0.0093 MJy sr-1 at 3.6 and 4.5 mum, respectively. Our azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile typically traces isophotes at mu3.6 mum ( AB ) ( 1 sigma ) ˜ 27 mag arcsec-2 , equivalent to a stellar mass surface density of ˜ 1 M&sun; pc-2. S4G thus provides an unprecedented data set for the study of the distribution of mass and stellar structures in the local universe. This large, unbiased, and extremely deep sample of all Hubble types from dwarfs to spirals to ellipticals will allow for detailed structural studies, not only as a function of stellar mass, but also as a function of the local environment. The data from this survey will serve as a vital testbed for cosmological simulations predicting the stellar mass properties of present-day galaxies. This article introduces the survey and describes the sample selection, the significance of the 3.6 and 4.5 mum bands for this study, and the data collection and survey strategies. We describe the S4G data analysis pipeline and present measurements for a first set of galaxies, observed in both the cryogenic and warm mission phases of Spitzer. For every galaxy we tabulate the galaxy diameter, position angle, axial ratio, inclination at mu3.6 mum ( AB ) = 25.5 , and 26.5 mag arcsec-2 (equivalent to ≈ muB ( AB ) = 27.2 and 28.2 mag arcsec-2 , respectively). These measurements will form the initial S4G catalog of galaxy properties. We also measure the total magnitude and the azimuthally averaged radial profiles of ellipticity, position angle, surface brightness, and color. Finally, using the galaxy-fitting code GALFIT, we deconstruct each galaxy into its main constituent stellar components: the bulge/spheroid, disk, bar, and nuclear point source, where necessary. Together, these data products will provide a comprehensive and definitive catalog of stellar structures, mass, and properties of galaxies in the nearby universe and will enable a variety of scientific investigations, some of which are highlighted in this introductory S4G survey paper.},
